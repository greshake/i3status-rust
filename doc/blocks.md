Define blocks in your config file in the following format:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "insert-block-name-here"
```

Each block has different required or optional parameters that may be specified.
These are listed in the docs for each block below.

In addition, there are some global config directives that can be applied to any block.  
`on_click`: this can be set for any block to run a command when the block is left clicked.
This will override any default actions the block already has.

Some blocks support format strings - refer to the [formatting section](#formatting) to see how to customize formatting strings' placeholders.

You may find that the block you desire is not in the list below. In that case, first see the [`custom` block examples](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/blob/master/examples/README.md) for inspiration of how you can easily create additional blocks using the `custom` block.

## Apt

Creates a block which displays the pending updates available for your Debian/Ubuntu based system.

Behind the scenes this uses `apt`, and in order to run it without root privileges i3status-rust will create its own package database in `/tmp/i3rs-apt/` which may take up several MB or more. If you have a custom apt config then this block may not work as expected - in that case please open an issue.

Tip: You can grab the list of available updates using `APT_CONFIG=/tmp/i3rs-apt/apt.conf apt list --upgradable`

#### Examples

Update the list of pending updates every thirty minutes (1800 seconds):

```toml
[[block]]
block = "apt"
interval = 1800
format = "{count:1} updates available"
format_singular = "{count:1} update available"
format_up_to_date = "system up to date"
critical_updates_regex = "(linux|linux-lts|linux-zen)"
# shows dmenu with cached available updates. Any dmenu alternative should also work.
on_click = "APT_CONFIG=/tmp/i3rs-apt/apt.conf apt list --upgradable | tail -n +2 | rofi -dmenu"
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`interval` | Update interval in seconds. | No | `600`
`format` | A string to customise the output of this block. See below for available placeholders. Text may need to be escaped, refer to [Escaping Text](#escaping-text). | No | `"{count:1}"`
`format_singular` | Same as `format`, but for when exactly one update is available. | No | `"{count:1}"`
`format_up_to_date` | Same as `format`, but for when no updates are available. | No | `"{count:1}"`
`warning_updates_regex` | Display block as warning if updates matching regex are available. | No | `None`
`critical_updates_regex` | Display block as critical if updates matching regex are available. | No | `None`

#### Available Format Keys

Key | Value | Type
----|-------|-----
`{count}` | Number of updates available | Integer

#### Notes

The number one in `{count:1}` sets the minimal width to one character.

#### Icons Used

- `update`

## Backlight

Creates a block to display screen brightness. This is a simplified version of the [Xrandr](#xrandr) block that reads brightness information directly from the filesystem, so it works under Wayland. The block uses `inotify` to listen for changes in the device's brightness directly, so there is no need to set an update interval.

When there is no `device` specified, this block will display information from the first device found in the `/sys/class/backlight` directory. If you only have one display, this approach should find it correctly.

It is possible to set the brightness using this block as well -- [see below](#setting-brightness-with-the-mouse-wheel) for details.

#### Examples

Show brightness for a specific device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
device = "intel_backlight"
```

Show brightness for the default device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
```

Setup bounds and cycle:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
minimum = 15
maximum = 100
cycle = [100, 50, 0, 50]
```

Note that `cycle = []` will disable cycling, and `cycle = [n]` will reset brightness to `n` on each click

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`device` | The `/sys/class/backlight` device to read brightness information from. | No | Default device
`format` | A string to customise the output of this block. See below for available placeholders. Text may need to be escaped, refer to [Escaping Text](#escaping-text). | No | `"{brightness}"`
`step_width` | The brightness increment to use when scrolling, in percent. | No | `5`
`minimum` | The minimum brightness that can be scrolled down to | No | `1`
`maximum` | The maximum brightness that can be scrolled up to | No | `100`
`cycle` | The brightnesses to cycle through on each click | No | `[minimum, maximum]`
`root_scaling` | Scaling exponent reciprocal (ie. root). | No | `1.0`
`invert_icons` | Invert icons' ordering, useful if you have colorful emoji. | No | `false`

Some devices expose raw values that are best handled with nonlinear scaling. The human perception of lightness is close to the cube root of relative luminance, so settings for `root_scaling` between 2.4 and 3.0 are worth trying. For devices with few discrete steps this should be 1.0 (linear). More information: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightness>

Also be aware that some devices turn off when brightness is set to `0`. Be careful when setting `minimum` to 0.

#### Available Format Keys

Placeholder | Description | Type
------------|-------------|-----
`{brightness}` | Device brightness percentage | String or Integer

#### Setting Brightness with the Mouse Wheel

The block allows for setting brightness with the mouse wheel and toggling min/max brightness on click. However, depending on how you installed i3status-rust, it may not have the appropriate permissions to modify these files, and will fail silently. To remedy this you can write a `udev` rule for your system (if you are comfortable doing so).

First, check that your user is a member of the "video" group using the `groups` command. Then add a rule in the `/etc/udev/rules.d/` directory containing the following, for example in `backlight.rules`:

```
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", GROUP="video", MODE="0664"
```

This will allow the video group to modify all backlight devices. You will also need to restart for this rule to take effect.

#### Icons Used

- `backlight_empty` (when brightness between 0 and 6%)
- `backlight_1` (when brightness between 7 and 13%)
- `backlight_2` (when brightness between 14 and 20%)
- `backlight_3` (when brightness between 21 and 26%)
- `backlight_4` (when brightness between 27 and 33%)
- `backlight_5` (when brightness between 34 and 40%)
- `backlight_6` (when brightness between 41 and 46%)
- `backlight_7` (when brightness between 47 and 53%)
- `backlight_8` (when brightness between 54 and 60%)
- `backlight_9` (when brightness between 61 and 67%)
- `backlight_10` (when brightness between 68 and 73%)
- `backlight_11` (when brightness between 74 and 80%)
- `backlight_12` (when brightness between 81 and 87%)
- `backlight_13` (when brightness between 88 and 93%)
- `backlight_full` (when brightness above 94%)

## Battery

Creates a block which displays the current battery state (Full, Charging or Discharging), percentage charged and estimate time until (dis)charged.

The battery block collapses when the battery is fully charged -- or, in the case of some Thinkpad batteries, when it reports "Not charging".

The battery block supports reading charging and status information from either `sysfs`, [apcaccess](http://www.apcaccess.org/manual/manual.html#nis-server-client-configuration-using-the-net-driver), or the [UPower](https://upower.freedesktop.org/) D-Bus interface. These "drivers" have largely identical features, but UPower does include support for `device = "DisplayDevice"`, which treats all physical power sources as a single logical battery. This is particularly useful if your system has multiple batteries.

#### Examples

Update the battery state every ten seconds, and show the time remaining until (dis)charging is complete:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "battery"
interval = 10
format = "{percentage} {time}"
```

Same as previous, but also prints a six character bar.

```toml
[[block]]
block = "battery"
interval = 10
format = "{percentage:6#100} {percentage} {time}"
```

Rely on Upower for battery updates and information:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "battery"
driver = "upower"
format = "{percentage} {time}"
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`device` | `sysfs`: The device in `/sys/class/power_supply/` to read from.<br />`apcaccess`: IPv4Address/hostname:port<br/>`UPower`: this can be `"DisplayDevice"` or any of the other paths found by running `upower --enumerate`. | No | `sysfs`: the first battery device found in `/sys/class/power_supply`, usually "BAT0".<br />`apcaccess`: "localhost:3551"<br />`upower`:  `DisplayDevice``
`driver` | One of `"sysfs"`, `"apcaccess"`, or `"upower"`. | No | `"sysfs"`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. Only relevant for `driver = "sysfs" \|\| "apcaccess"`. | No | `10`
`format` | A string to customise the output of this block. See below for available placeholders. Text may need to be escaped, refer to [Escaping Text](#escaping-text). | No | `"{percentage}"`
`full_format` | Same as `format` but for when the battery is full. | No | `"{percentage}"`
`missing_format` | Same as `format` but for when the specified battery is missing. | No | `"{percentage}"`
`allow_missing` | Don't display errors when the battery cannot be found. | No | `false`
`hide_missing` | Completely hide this block if the battery cannot be found. Only works in combination with `allow_missing`. | No | `false`
`full_threshold` | Percentage at which the battery is considered full (`full_format` shown) | No | `100`
`good` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to good. | No | `60`
`info` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to info. | No | `60`
`warning` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to warning. | No | `30`
`critical` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to critical. | No | `15`

#### Available Format Keys

Placeholder | Description | Type
------------|-------------|-----
`{percentage}` | Battery level, in percent | String or Integer
`{time}` | Time remaining until (dis)charge is complete | String
`{power}` | Power consumption by the battery or from the power supply when charging | String or Float

#### Icons Used

## Bluetooth

Creates a block which displays the connectivity of a given Bluetooth device, or the battery level if this is supported. Relies on the Bluez D-Bus API, and is therefore asynchronous.

When the device can be identified as an audio headset, a keyboard, joystick, or mouse, use the relevant icon. Otherwise, fall back on the generic Bluetooth symbol.

Right-clicking the block will attempt to connect (or disconnect) the device.

#### Examples

## Custom

Creates a block that display the output of custom shell commands.

For further customisation, use the `json` option and have the shell command output valid JSON in the schema below:  
`{"icon": "ICON", "state": "STATE", "text": "YOURTEXT"}`  
`icon` is optional, it may be an icon name from `icons.rs` (default "")  
`state` is optional, it may be Idle, Info, Good, Warning, Critical (default Idle)  

See [`examples`](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/blob/master/examples/README.md) for a list of how many functionalities can be easily achieved using the `custom` block.

#### Examples

command = ''' cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp | awk '{printf("%.1f\n",$1/1000)}' '''
```

Cycle between "ON" and "OFF", update every 1 second, run `<command>` when block is clicked:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
cycle = ["echo ON", "echo OFF"]
on_click = "<command>"
interval = 1
```

Use JSON output:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
command = "echo '{\"icon\":\"weather_thunder\",\"state\":\"Critical\", \"text\": \"Danger!\"}'"
json = true
```

Display kernel, update the block only once:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
command = "uname -r"
interval = "once"
```

Display the screen brightness on an intel machine and update this only when `pkill -SIGRTMIN+4 i3status-rs` is called:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
command = ''' cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness | awk '{print $1}' '''
signal = 4
interval = "once"
```

Update block when one or more specified files are modified:

or  
`busctl --user call i3.status.rs /CurrentSoundDevice i3.status.rs SetStatus s Headphones`  

qdbus:
`qdbus i3.status.rs /CurrentSoundDevice i3.status.rs.SetStatus Headphones music Good`.  

The first argument is the text content of the block, the second (optional) argument is the icon to use (as found in `icons.rs`; default `""`), and the third (optional) argument is the state (one of Idle, Info, Good, Warning, or Critical; default Idle).

##### Notes
All the information comes from https://ipapi.co/json/ 
Check their documentation here: https://ipapi.co/api/#complete-location5

The IP is queried, 1) When i3status-rs starts, 2) When a signal is received
on D-Bus about a network configuration change, 3) Every 5 minutes. This
periodic refresh exists to catch IP updates that don't trigger a notification,
for example due to a IP refresh at the router.

Flags: They are not icons but unicode glyphs. You will need a font that
includes them. Tested with: https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Fonts/Flags.html

## Focused Window

Creates a block which displays the title or the active marks of the currently focused window. Uses push updates from i3 IPC, so no need to worry about resource usage. The block only updates when the focused window changes title or the focus changes. Also works with sway, due to it having compatibility with i3's IPC.

## Keyboard Layout

Creates a block to display the current keyboard layout.

Four drivers are available:
- `setxkbmap` which polls setxkbmap to get the current layout
- `localebus` which can read asynchronous updates from the systemd `org.freedesktop.locale1` D-Bus path
- `kbddbus` which uses [kbdd](https://github.com/qnikst/kbdd) to monitor per-window layout changes via DBus
- `xkbswitch` which uses [xkb-switch](https://github.com/grwlf/xkb-switch) to show the current layout and variant. This works when `setxkbmap` is used to set a comma separated list of layouts, such as `us,es,fr`.
- `sway` which can read asynchronous updates from the sway IPC

Which of these methods is appropriate will depend on your system setup.

#### Examples

Check `setxkbmap` every 15 seconds:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "setxkbmap"
interval = 15
```

Use the [`xkb-switch`](https://github.com/grwlf/xkb-switch) X11 tool to switch to next `setxkbmap` layout on click:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "setxkbmap"
on_click = "xkb-switch -n"
interval = 1
```

Listen to D-Bus for changes:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "localebus"
```

Listen to kbdd for changes:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "kbddbus"
```

Poll `xkb-switch` for current layout and variant:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "xkbswitch"
on_click = "xkb-switch -n"
format = "{layout} {variant}"
interval = 1
```

Listen to sway for changes:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "sway"
sway_kb_identifier = "1133:49706:Gaming_Keyboard_G110"
```

Listen to sway for changes and override mappings:
```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "sway"
format = "{layout}"
[block.mappings]
"English (Workman)" = "EN"
"Russian (N/A)" = "RU"
```

## Music

Creates a block to display the current song title and artist in a fixed-width marquee. Also provides buttons for play/pause, previous and next.
When there is no song playing the block collapses to show just the icon and any configured buttons.

Supports all music players that implement the [MediaPlayer2 Interface](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/Player_Interface.html). This includes:

- Spotify
- VLC
- mpd (via [mpDris2](https://github.com/eonpatapon/mpDris2))

and many others.

By default the block tracks all players available on the MPRIS bus. Right clicking on the block will cycle it to the next player (if the next player has no song playing then the block will collapse, however you can continue to right click to the next player.).  You can pin the widget to a given player via the "player" setting.

#### Examples

Show the currently playing song on Spotify only, with play & next buttons:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
player = "spotify"
buttons = ["play", "next"]
```

Same thing for any compatible player, takes the first active on the bus, but ignores "mpd" or anything with "kdeconnect" in the name:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
buttons = ["play", "next"]
interface_name_exclude = [".*kdeconnect.*", "mpd"]
```

Start Spotify if the block is clicked whilst it's collapsed:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
on_collapsed_click = "spotify"
```

## Nvidia Gpu

Creates a block which can display the name, utilization, temperature, memory usage, fan speed and clock speed of your NVidia GPU.

By default the name provided by `nvidia-smi` will be shown. If `label` is set then clicking the left mouse button on the "name" part of the block will alternate it between showing the default name or `label`.

By default `show_temperature` shows the used memory. Clicking the left mouse on the "temperature" part of the block will alternate it between showing used or total available memory.

When using `show_fan_speed`, clicking the left mouse button on the "fan speed" part of the block will cause it to enter into a fan speed setting mode. In this mode you can scroll the mouse wheel over the block to change the fan speeds, and left click to exit the mode.

Requires `nvidia-smi` for displaying info and `nvidia_settings` for setting fan speed.

#### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "nvidia_gpu"
label = "GT 1030"
show_memory = false
show_clocks = true
interval = 1
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default

## Pacman

Creates a block which displays the pending updates available on pacman or an AUR helper.

Requires fakeroot to be installed (only required for pacman).

Tip: You can grab the list of available updates using `fakeroot pacman -Qu --dbpath /tmp/checkup-db-yourusername/`. If you have the CHECKUPDATES_DB env var set on your system then substitute that dir instead of /tmp/checkup-db-yourusername.

Tip: On Arch Linux you can setup a `pacman` hook to signal i3status-rs to update after packages have been upgraded, so you won't have stale info in your pacman block. Create `/usr/share/libalpm/hooks/i3status.hook` with the below contents:

Note: `pikaur` may hang the whole block if there is no internet connectivity. In that case, try a different AUR helper.
```ini
[Trigger]
Operation = Upgrade
Type = Package
Target = *

[Action]
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /usr/bin/pkill -SIGUSR1 i3status-rs
```

#### Examples

Update the list of pending updates every ten minutes (600 seconds):

Update interval should be set appropriately as to not exceed the AUR's daily rate limit.

pacman only config:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "pacman"
interval = 600
format = "{pacman} updates available"
format_singular = "{pacman} update available"
format_up_to_date = "system up to date"
critical_updates_regex = "(linux|linux-lts|linux-zen)"
# pop-up a menu showing the available updates. Replace wofi with your favourite menu command.
on_click = "fakeroot pacman -Qu --dbpath /tmp/checkup-db-yourusername/ | wofi --show dmenu"
```

pacman only config using warnings with ZFS modules:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "pacman"
interval = 600
format = "{pacman} updates available"
format_singular = "{pacman} update available"
format_up_to_date = "system up to date"
# If a linux update is availble, but no ZFS package, it won't be possible to
# actually perform a system upgrade, so we show a warning.
warning_updates_regex = "(linux|linux-lts|linux-zen)"
# If ZFS is available, we know that we can and should do an upgrade, so we show
# the status as critical.
critical_updates_regex = "(zfs|zfs-lts)"
```

pacman and AUR helper config:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "pacman"
interval = 600
format = "{pacman} + {aur} = {both} updates available"
format_singular = "{both} update available"
format_up_to_date = "system up to date"
critical_updates_regex = "(linux|linux-lts|linux-zen)"

## Sound

Creates a block which displays the volume level (according to PulseAudio or ALSA). Right click to toggle mute, scroll to adjust volume.

Requires a PulseAudio installation or `alsa-utils` for ALSA.

PulseAudio support is a feature and can be turned on (`--features "pulseaudio"`) / off (`--no-default-features`) during build with `cargo`.
If PulseAudio support is enabled the `"auto"` driver will first try to connect to PulseAudio and then fallback to ALSA on error.

Note that if you are using PulseAudio commands (such as `pactl`) to control your volume, you should select the `"pulseaudio"` (or `"auto"`) driver to see volume changes that exceed 100%.

#### Examples

Change the default scrolling step width to 3 percent:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "sound"
step_width = 3
```

```toml
[[block]]
block = "sound"
format = "{output_description} {volume}"
```

```toml
[[block]]

## Temperature

Creates a block which displays the system temperature, based on `libsensors` library. The block has two modes: "collapsed", which uses only colour as an indicator, and "expanded", which shows the content of a `format` string.

Requires `libsensors` and appropriate kernel modules for your hardware.

The average, minimum, and maximum temperatures are computed using all sensors displayed by `sensors`, or optionally filtered by `chip` and `inputs`.

Note that the colour of the block is always determined by the maximum temperature across all sensors, not the average. You may need to keep this in mind if you have a misbehaving sensor.

#### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "temperature"
collapsed = false
interval = 10
format = "{min} min, {max} max, {average} avg"
chip = "*-isa-*"
inputs = ["CPUTIN", "SYSTIN"]
```

#### Options

`warning` | Maximum temperature to set state to warning. Beyond this temperature, state is set to critical. | No | `80` °C (`176` °F)
`chip` | Narrows the results to a given chip name. If driver = `"sensors"` then `*` may be used as a wildcard. If driver = `"sysfs"` then narrows to chips whose '"/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/name"' is a substring of the given chip name or vice versa. `sysfs` can not match to the bus such as `*-isa-*` or `*-pci-*`). | No | None
`inputs` | Narrows the results to individual inputs reported by each chip. | No | None
`format` | A string to customise the output of this block. See below for available placeholders. Text may need to be escaped, refer to [Escaping Text](#escaping-text). | No | `"{average} avg, {max} max"`

#### Deprecated options

## Toggle

Creates a toggle block. You can add commands to be executed to disable the toggle (`command_off`), and to enable it (`command_on`). If these command exit with a non-zero status, the block will not be toggled and the block state will be changed to give a visual warning of the failure.
You also need to specify a command to determine the initial state of the toggle (`command_state`). When the command outputs nothing, the toggle is disabled, otherwise enabled.
By specifying the `interval` property you can let the `command_state` be executed continuously.

#### Examples

This is what I use to toggle my external monitor configuration:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "toggle"

text = "4k"
command_state = "xrandr | grep DP1\\ connected\\ 38 | grep -v eDP1"
command_on = "~/.screenlayout/4kmon_default.sh"
command_off = "~/.screenlayout/builtin.sh"
interval = 5
```

```toml
[[block]]
block = "watson"
show_time = true
state_path = "/home/user/.config/watson/state"
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default

`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `60`

## Weather

Creates a block which displays local weather and temperature information. In order to use this block, you will need access to a supported weather API service. At the time of writing, OpenWeatherMap is the only supported service.

Configuring the Weather block requires configuring a weather service, which may require API keys and other parameters.

If using the `autolocate` feature, set the block update interval such that you do not exceed ipapi.co's free daily limit of 1000 hits.

#### Examples

Show detailed weather in San Francisco through the OpenWeatherMap service:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "weather"
format = "{weather} ({location}) {temp}, {wind} m/s {direction}"
service = { name = "openweathermap", api_key = "XXX", city_id = "5398563", units = "metric" }
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`format` | A string to customise the output of this block. See below for available placeholders. Text may need to be escaped, refer to [Escaping Text](#escaping-text). | No | `"{weather} {temp}"`
`service` | The configuration of a weather service (see below). | Yes | None
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `600`
`autolocate` | Gets your location using the ipapi.co IP location service (no API key required). If the API call fails then the block will fallback to `city_id` or `place`. | No | false

#### OpenWeatherMap Options

To use the service you will need a (free) API key.

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`name` | `openweathermap`. | Yes | None
`api_key` | Your OpenWeatherMap API key. | Yes | None
`city_id` | OpenWeatherMap's ID for the city. | Yes* | None

`units` | Either `metric` or `imperial`. | Yes | `metric`
`lang` | Language code. See [here](https://openweathermap.org/current#multi). Currently only affects `weather_verbose` key. | No | `en`

One of `city_id`, `place` or `coordinates` is required. If more than one are supplied, `city_id` takes precedence over `place` which takes place over `coordinates`.

The options `api_key`, `city_id`, `place` can be omitted from configuration,
in which case they must be provided in the environment variables
`OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY`, `OPENWEATHERMAP_CITY_ID`, `OPENWEATHERMAP_PLACE`.

## Xrandr

Creates a block which shows screen information (name, brightness, resolution). With a click you can toggle through your active screens and with wheel up and down you can adjust the selected screens brightness. Regarding brightness control, xrandr changes the brightness of the display using gamma rather than changing the brightness in hardware, so if that is not desirable then consider using the `backlight` block instead.

NOTE: Some users report issues (e.g. [here](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/issues/274), [here](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/issues/668) and [here](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/issues/1364)) when using this block. The cause is currently unknown, however setting a higher update interval may help.

#### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "xrandr"
icons = true
resolution = true
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`format` | A string to customise the output of this block. See below for available placeholders. Text may need to be escaped, refer to [Escaping Text](#escaping-text). | No | Depends on `icons` and `resolution`. With default `icons` and `resolution` the default value is `"{display} {brightness_icon} {brightness}"``
`step_width` | The steps brightness is in/decreased for the selected screen (When greater than 50 it gets limited to 50). | No | `5`
`interval` | Update interval in seconds. | No | `5`

Placeholder         | Value                        | Type   | Unit

## Escaping text
For blocks where the `format` string or `command` output can be configured by the user, you may need to escape any Pango characters otherwise the block may fail to render (i3) and/or throw errors to stderr (sway).

### List of characters that require escaping

Char | Escaped
-----|--------
  `<`  | `&lt;`
  `>`  | `&gt;`
  `&`  | `&amp;`
  `'`  | `&#39;`

e.g.
```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
# need to escape ampersand
#command = "echo '<b>1 &</b>'"
# escaped ampersand
command = "echo '<b>1 &amp;</b>'"
```

# Formatting

All blocks that have a `format` field can be reformatted by changing their format strings.

The field can be set as a string (`format = "{my_format}"`) or as a section:
```toml
[[block]]
block = "my_block"
[block.format]
full = "{my_full_format}"
short = "{my_short_format}"
```
Your `i3` or `sway` will switch all blocks over to the `short` variant whenever there isn't enough space on your screen for the `full` status bar.

## Syntax

The syntax for placeholders is

```
{<name>[:[0]<min width>][^<max width>][;[ ][_]<min prefix>][*[_]<unit>][#<bar max value>]}
```

### `<name>`

This is just a name of a placeholder. Each block that uses formatting will list them under "Available Format Keys" section of their config.

### `[0]<min width>`

Sets the minimum width of the content (in characters). If starts with a zero, `0` symbol will be used to pad the content. A space is used otherwise. Floats and Integers are shifted to the right, while Strings are to the left. Defaults to `0` for Strings, `2` for Integers and `3` for Floats.

#### Examples (spaces are shown as '□' to make the differences more obvious)

`"{var:3}"`

The value of `var` | Output
-------------------|--------
`"abc"`            | `"abc"`
`"abcde"`          | `"abcde"`
`"ab"`             | `"ab□"`
`1`                | `"□□1"`
`1234`             | `"1234"`
`1.0`              | `"1.0"`
`12.0`             | `"□12"`
`123.0`            | `"123"`
`1234.0`           | `"1234"`

### `<max width>`

Sets the maximum width of the content (in characters). Applicable only for Strings.

#### Examples

`"{var^3}"`

The value of `var` | Output
-------------------|--------
`"abc"`            | `"abc"`
`"abcde"`          | `"abc"`
`"ab"`             | `"ab"`

### `[ ][_]<min prefix>`

Float values are formatted following [engineering notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_notation). This option sets the minimal SI prefix to use. The default value is `1` (no prefix) for bytes/bits and `n` (for nano) for everything else. Possible values are `n`, `u`, `m`, `1`, `K`, `M`, `G` and `T`.

Prepend an underscore `_` to hide the prefix (i.e. don't display it).

Prepend a space ` ` to add a space between the value and prefix.

#### Examples

`"{var:3;n}"`

The value of `var` | Output
-------------------|--------
`0.0001`           | "100u"
`0.001`            | "1.0m"
`0.01`             | " 10m"
`0.1`              | "100m"
`1.0`              | "1.0"
`12.0`             | " 12"
`123.0`            | "123"
`1234.0`           | "1.2K"

`"{var:3; 1}"`

The value of `var` | Output
-------------------|--------
`0.0001`           | "0.0 "
`0.001`            | "0.0 "
`0.01`             | "0.0 "
`0.1`              | "0.1 "
`1.0`              | "1.0 "
`12.0`             | " 12 "
`123.0`            | "123 "
`1234.0`           | "1.2 K"

`"{var:3;_K}"`

The value of `var` | Output
-------------------|--------
`1.0`              | "0.0"
`12.0`             | "0.0"
`123.0`            | "0.1"
`1234.0`           | "1.2"
`12345.0`          | " 12"

### `[_]<unit>`

Some placeholders have a "unit". For example, `net` block displays speed in bytes per second by default. This option gives ability to convert one units into another. Ignored for strings. Prepend the unit with the underscore `_` to hide the unit (i.e. don't display it).

#### The list of units

 Unit |         Means        | Displays
------|----------------------|---------
 B    | Bytes                | B
 b    | Bits                 | b
 %    | Percents             | %
 deg  | Degrees              | °
 s    | Seconds              | s
 W    | Watts                | W
 Hz   | Hertz                | Hz

#### Example

`"{speed_down*b}"` - show the download speed in bits per second.

`"{speed_down*_b}"` - show the download speed in bits per second, but hide the "b".

`"{speed_down*_}"` - show the download speed in it's default units, but hide the units.

`"{speed_down*_b}Bi/s"` - show the download in bits per second, and display the unit as "Bi/s" instead of "b".

### `<bar max value>`

Every numeric placeholder (Integers and Floats) can be drawn as a bar. This option sets the value to be considered "100%". If this option is set, every other option will be ignored, except for `min width`, which will set the length of a bar.

#### Example

```toml
[[block]]
block = "sound"
format = "{volume:5#110} {volume:03}"
```

Here, `{volume:5#110}` means "draw a bar, 5 character long, with 100% being 110.
