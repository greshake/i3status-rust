### New Blocks and Features

* Battery: added `charging_format` config option.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

* Net: fix `missing_format` option.
* Backlight: fix "calibright config error".

### Packaging

# i3status-rust 0.30.7

### Future Compatibility Notes

* In version 0.31 sound's `mappings_use_regex` will default to `true`.

* In the future `block = "..."` will be required to be the first field of block configs. 
  This will be so that block configuration errors will not break the entire bar.
  For example,
  ```toml
  [[block]]
  block = "time"
  format = "..."
  ```
  will work but
  ```toml
  [[block]]
  format = "..."
  block = "time"
  ```
  will fail.

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

* Kdeconnect: do not fail if notifications are not available.
* Fix a panic when formatting a number as tebibytes.
* Custom: set `command` stdin to `null`. This prevents custom commands from stealing click events.
* Fix _some_ rounding errors in `.eng` formatter.

# i3status-rust 0.30.6

### New Blocks and Features

* New block: `vpn`: Shows the current connection status for VPN networks. Currently only `nordvpn` is supported (#1725).
* Padding character of `eng` formatter is now configurable. For example, `$volume.eng(pad_with:0)` will render as `05%` instead of ` 5%`.
* Bluetooth: added `battery_state` config option which allows to customize block's color in relation to device battery level (#1836).
* Bluetooth: added `$battery_icon` placeholder (#1837).
* Time: Right click on the block to reverse cycle between timezones (#1839).

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

# i3status-rust 0.30.0

This is a major release in which the core has been rewritten to be asynchronous, and the formatting system has also been overhauled.

Block documentation was moved from `docs/blocks.md` to: https://greshake.github.io/i3status-rust/i3status_rs/blocks/index.html
Formatter documentation is available here: https://greshake.github.io/i3status-rust/i3status_rs/formatting/index.html

Breaking changes are listed below, however you may also want to compare the example config between v0.22 and v0.30 to get a general idea of changes made to the configuration format:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greshake/i3status-rust/v0.22.0/examples/config.toml

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greshake/i3status-rust/v0.30.0/examples/config.toml

### General / top-level breaking changes

- Placeholders in `format` strings are now denoted by a dollar sign rather than enclosed in brackets. For example, `format = "{percentage}"` would now be `format = "$percentage"`.

- Icons are now part of the `format` string option as a placeholder in blocks where format is customisable.
  If you have modified `format` and would like to keep the same behaviour (icon, whitespace) you need to update the value. For example,
  ```toml
  [[block]]
  block = "cpu"
  format = "{utilization}"
  ```
  needs to be changed to:
  ```toml
  [[block]]
  block = "cpu"
  format = " $icon $utilization "
  ```
  
- Icons can now be referenced by name within `format` strings, e.g. `format = " Hello ^icon_ping "` will use the icon `ping` from the icon set that is currently in use.

- Top-level `theme` and `icons` config options have been removed. For example,
  ```toml
  theme = "solarized-dark"
  icons = "awesome5"
  ```
  needs to be changed to:
  ```toml
  [theme]
  theme = "solarized-dark"
  [icons]
  icons = "awesome5"
  ```
  Additionally, the `name` and `file` options have been merged into `theme`/`icons`. For example,
  ```toml
  [theme]
  name = "awesome5"
  [icons]
  file = "/path/to/my/custom_iconset.toml"
  ```
  needs to be changed to:
  ```toml
  [theme]
  theme = "awesome5"
  [icons]
  icons = "/path/to/my/custom_iconset.toml"
  ```
- Font Awesome v4 must now be specified via `awesome4`, and `awesome` has been removed.

- Icons `backlight_{empty,full,1,2,...,13}`, `bat_{10,20,...,90,full}`, `cpu_{low,med,high}`, `volume_{empty,half,full}`, `microphone_{empty,half,full}` have been removed as singular icons, and instead implemented as an array. If you used to override any of these icons, override `backlight`, `cpu`, `volume` and `microphone` instead. For example,
  ```toml
  cpu_low = "\U000F0F86" # nf-md-speedometer_slow
  cpu_med = "\U000F0F85" # nf-md-speedometer_medium
  cpu_high = "\U000F04C5" # nf-md-speedometer
  ```
  becomes
  ```toml
  cpu = [
      "\U000F0F86", # nf-md-speedometer_slow
      "\U000F0F85", # nf-md-speedometer_medium
      "\U000F04C5", # nf-md-speedometer
  ]
  ```
- when using theme overrides, you can now reference other colours by name which allows you to avoid redefining the same colour twice, for example:
  ```toml
  [[block]]
  block = "sound"
  driver = "pulseaudio"
  device = "@DEFAULT_SOURCE@"
  device_kind = "source"
  [block.theme_overrides]
  # switch idle and warning around in order to get warning when mic is *not* muted
  idle_fg = { link = "warning_fg" }
  idle_bg = { link = "warning_bg" }
  warning_fg = { link = "idle_fg" }
  warning_bg = { link = "idle_bg" }
  ```

- `scrolling` option has been renamed to `invert_scrolling` and now accepts `true` or `false`.

- `on_click` is now implemented as `[[block.click]]`. For example,
  ```toml
  [[block]]
  block = "pacman"
  on_click = "random_command"
  ```
  needs to be changed to:
  ```toml
  [[block]]
  block = "pacman"
  [[block.click]]
  button = "left"
  cmd = "random_command"
  ```

### Block specific breaking changes

Block | Changes
----|-----------
apt, dnf, pacman | `hide_when_uptodate` option is removed and now you can use `format_up_to_date = ""` to hide the block
battery | `full_threshold` now defaults to `95` as often batteries never fully charge
battery | requires device name from `/sys/class/power_supply` even when using UPower driver (previously it used the name from the output of `upower --enumerate`)
battery | `hide_missing` option is replaced with `missing_format`. You can set `missing_format = ""` to maintain the behavior
battery | `hide_full` option is removed. You can set `full_format = ""` to maintain the behavior
bluetooth | `hide_disconnected` option is replaced with `disconnected_format`. You can set `disconnected_format = ""` to hide the block
cpu | The custom `info`, `warning` and `critical` thresholds have been removed
custom_dbus | `name` has been renamed to `path` and the DBus object is now at `rs.i3status`/`rs.i3status.custom` rather than `i3.status.rs`
disk_space | `alias` has been removed in favour of using `format`
focused_window | `autohide` is removed. You can format to `" $title.str(w:21) \| Missing "` to display the block when title is missing
focused_window | `max_width` has been removed, and can instead be implemented via the new formatter. For example `max_width = 15; format = "{title}"` is now `format = "$title.str(max_w:15)"`
kdeconnect | now only supports kdeconnect v20.11.80 and newer (December 2020 and newer)
keyboard_layout | `xkbswitch` driver is removed pending re-implementation (see #1512)
memory | `clickable`, `display_type`, `format_mem` and `format_swap` are removed and now you can use `format` and `format_alt` to maintain the behavior
music | `smart_trim`, `max_width` and `marquee` have been removed. All these settings are now configured inside the format string.
music | `buttons` has been removed and is now configured via the new `[[block.click]]` syntax. New analogue `format` placeholders (`$play`/`$next`/`$prev`) have been added
net |`hide_missing` and `hide_inactive` are removed. You can set `missing_format = ""`
net | formatting for `graph_down` and `graph_up` is not yet implemented (see #1555)
notmuch | `name` option is removed and now you can use `format` to set it
temperature | `collapsed` option is removed and now you can use `format_alt = " $icon "` to maintain the behavior
time | `locale` option is removed and now you can use `format` to set it, e.g. `format = " $icon $timestamp.datetime(f:'%d/%m %R', l:fr_BE) "`
toggle | `text` option is removed and now you can use `format` to set it

### Removed blocks

- `ibus` block has been removed. Suggested example replacement:
  ```toml
  [[block]]
  block = "custom"
  command = "ibus engine"
  ```
- `networkmanager` block has been removed (could be revisited in the future), so `net` block should be used instead.
  Note there is no equivalent to `interface_name_exclude` in `net` as it only shows one interface at a time.
  
  Example of a `networkmanager` config ported to `net`:  
  
  v0.22:  
  ```toml
  [[block]]
  block = "networkmanager"
  on_click = "alacritty -e nmtui"
  interface_name_include = ['br\-[0-9a-f]{12}', 'docker\d+']
  ```
  
  v0.30:  
  ```toml
  [[block]]
  block = "net"
  device = 'br\-[0-9a-f]{12}'
  [[block.click]]
  button = "left"
  cmd = "alacritty -e nmtui"

  [[block]]
  block = "net"
  device = 'docker\d+'
  [[block.click]]
  button = "left"
  cmd = "alacritty -e nmtui"
  ```

### New features and bugfixes
- New `service_status` block: monitor the state of a (systemd) service.

- When blocks error they no longer take down the entire bar. Instead, they now enter error mode: "X" will be shown and on left click the full error message will be shown in the bar.
- `apt` block has new `ignore_phased_updates` option. (#1717)
- `battery` now supports `empty_threshold` to specify below which percentage the battery is considered empty, and `empty_format` to use a custom format when the battery is empty.
- `battery` now supports `not_charging_format` config option. (#1685)
- `custom_dbus` block can now be used more than once in your config.
- `custom` block has new config option `persistent` which runs a command in the background and updates the block text for each received output line.
- `focused_window` block now supports most wlroots-based compositors.
- `music` block now supports controlling and displaying the volume for individual players (#1722)
- `music` block now has `interface_name_exclude` and improved `playerctld` support (#1710)

- `weather` block now supports using met.no as an info source (#1577)
- More blocks now support `format` option (custom, custom_dbus, hueshift, maildir, notmuch, pomodoro, time, uptime)
- Some blocks now have debug logs which can be enabled like so: `RUST_LOG=block=debug i3status-rs` where "block" is the block name.
- Default click actions for blocks can now be remapped (#1686)

* Nvidia block: only run `nvidia-smi` once instead of spawning a new instance for each update (#1286 by @ZachCook)
* Weather block: escape spaces in internally generated URL (#1289 by @rbuch)

### Deprecation Warnings
`bat_half`, `bat_quarter`, `bat_three_quarters` are likely to be removed in a future release.

# i3status-rust 0.20.3

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

* Net block: fix SSID escape code decoding (#1274 by @GladOSkar)
* NetworkManager block: update DBus interface for newer versions of NM (#1269 by @mailhost)
* Pomodoro block: fix crash causing by pause icon typo (#1295 by @GladOSkar)

If you are manually managing your icon/theme files then you may want to update them now for the above fixes.

# i3status-rust 0.20.2

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

* Battery block: find battery by default instead of hardcoding "BAT0" (#1258 by @orvij)

* Formatter: allow spaces between the value and unit/prefix. For example, `"{key; K*b}"` results in "value Kb" and `"{key; _K*b}"` results in "val b".
* Add short_text support (#1207 by @GladOSkar)


### Breaking Changes

* Pomodoro block: Icons are no longer hardcoded. New icons: `pomodoro_started`, `pomodoro_stopped`, `pomodoro_paused`, `pomodoro_break` have been added to the icon themes in the repo, so you must update your icon theme files if it is not done by your package manager. (#1264)

### Deprecation Warnings

* Fixed pacman block crash due to stderr output of pacman itself (#1220 by @mpldr)
* Custom block example list has been created and documented (#1223 by @GladOSkar)

# i3status-rust 0.20.0

### Breaking Changes

Themes/Icons:

* These have been moved out into files instead of being hardcoded in the Rust source. The following folders are checked in this order: first `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3status-rust/<icons|themes>`, next `$HOME/.local/share/i3status-rust/<icons|themes>`, finally `/usr/share/i3status-rust/<icons|themes>`. If installing manually via cargo, you will need to copy the files to an appropriate location (an `install.sh` script is provided which does this). If installing via the AUR on Arch Linux, the package will install the files to `/usr/share/i3status-rust/<icons|themes>` for you, so you do not need to do anything (this should also be true for other distros assuming the package maintainer has packaged i3status-rust correctly). 

* Per block theme overrides have been renamed from `color_overrides` to `theme_overrides` (this was previously undocumented but has since been mentioned in themes.md)

Formatting:

* Formatting for all blocks using `format` strings has been overhauled to allow users to customise how numbers and strings are displayed, which was not possible previously. Due to this some blocks may now display slightly differently to previous versions and have been documented below. Refer to the [formatting documentation](doc/blocks.md#formatting) to get more information on the new formatting options.

Blocks: 

* CPU Utilization block: Due to an overhaul of our internal code, the `per_core` option has been removed. The same configuration can be achieved using the new `{utilization<n>}` format keys.
* Battery and Disk Space blocks: The `{bar}` format key has been removed in favor of the new [bar](doc/blocks.md#formatting#bar-max-value) formatter. For example, to make the Battery block display the current percentage as a 6 character bar with 100% as the max value, set the format string as so: `format = "{percentage:6#100}`. 
* Disk Space block: The `{unit}` format key has been removed since the unit of `{free}` and similar format keys don't rely on `unit` configuration option anymore.
* Maildir block: this is now optional and must be enabled at compile time (#1103 by @MaxVerevkin)
* Memory block: all old format keys have been removed, refer to the table below for more details.
* Net block: `use_bits`, `speed_min_unit`, `speed_digits` and `max_ssid_width` configuration options have been removed and require manual intervention to fix your config. `speed_min_unit` is replaced by the [min prefix](doc/blocks.md#min-prefix) formatter. `max_ssid_width` is replaced by the [max width](doc/blocks.md#0max-width) formatter.
* Net block: partially moved from calling external commands to using the netlink interface, which may not work on BSD systems (#1142 by @MaxVerevkin)
* Networkmanager block: `max_ssid_width` config option has been removed, but the behaviour can be restored using the [max width](doc/blocks.md#max-width) formatter. For example, `max_ssid_width = 10` is now achieved with `ap_format = "{ssid^10}"`.
* Sound block: `max_width` config option has been removed, but the behaviour can be restored using the [max width](doc/blocks.md#max-width) formatter.
* Speedtest block: `bytes`, `speed_min_unit` and `speed_digits` configuration options have been removed in favour of the new `format` string formatter. For example, to replicate `bytes=true; speed_min_unit="M", speed_digits=4` use `format = "{speed_down:4*B;M}{speed_up:4*B;M}"`

Memory block removed format keys:
