## Backlight

Creates a block to display screen brightness. This is a simplified version of the [Xrandr](#xrandr) block that reads brightness information directly from the filesystem, so it works under Wayland. The block uses `inotify` to listen for changes in the device's brightness directly, so there is no need to set an update interval.

When there is no `device` specified, this block will display information from the first device found in the `/sys/class/backlight` directory. If you only have one display, this approach should find it correctly.

It is possible to set the brightness using this block as well -- [see below](#setting-brightness-with-the-mouse-wheel) for details.

### Examples

Show brightness for a specific device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
device = "intel_backlight"
```

Show brightness for the default device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`device` | The `/sys/class/backlight` device to read brightness information from. | No | Default device
`step_width` | The brightness increment to use when scrolling, in percent. | No | `5`

### Setting Brightness with the Mouse Wheel

The block allows for setting brightness with the mouse wheel. However, depending on how you installed i3status-rust, it may not have the appropriate permissions to modify these files, and will fail silently. To remedy this you can write a `udev` rule for your system (if you are comfortable doing so).

First, check that your user is a member of the "video" group using the `groups` command. Then add a rule in the `/etc/udev/rules.d/` directory containing the following, for example in `backlight.rules`:

```
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", KERNEL=="acpi_video0", RUN+="/bin/chgrp video /sys/class/backlight/%k/brightness"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", KERNEL=="acpi_video0", RUN+="/bin/chmod g+w /sys/class/backlight/%k/brightness"
```

You will need to ensure that the value of the `KERNEL` parameter here is the same as the `device` used to configure the block. (You will also need to restart for this rule to take effect.)

## Battery

Creates a block which displays the current battery state (Full, Charging or Discharging), percentage charged and estimate time until (dis)charged.

The battery block collapses when the battery is fully charged -- or, in the case of some Thinkpad batteries, when it reports "Not charging".

The battery block supports reading charging and status information from either `sysfs` or the [UPower](https://upower.freedesktop.org/) D-Bus interface. These "drivers" have largely identical features, but UPower does include support for `device = "DisplayDevice"`, which treats all physical power sources as a single logical battery. This is particularly useful if your system has multiple batteries.

### Examples

Update the battery state every ten seconds, and show the time remaining until (dis)charging is complete:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "battery"
interval = 10
format = "{percentage}% {time}"
```

Rely on Upower for battery updates and information:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "battery"
driver = "upower"
format = "{percentage}% {time}"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`device` | The device in `/sys/class/power_supply/` to read from. When using UPower, this can also be `"DisplayDevice"`. | No | `"BAT0"`
`driver` | One of `"sysfs"` or `"upower"`. | No | `"sysfs"`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. Only relevant for `driver = "sysfs"`. | No | `10`
`format` | A format string. See below for available placeholders. | No | `"{percentage}%"`
`show` | Deprecated in favour of `format`. Show remaining `"time"`, `"percentage"` or `"both"` | No | `"percentage"`
`upower` | Deprecated in favour of `device`. When `true`, use the Upower D-Bus driver. | No | `false`

The `show` option is deprecated, and will be removed in future versions. In the meantime, it will override the `format` option when present.

### Format string

Placeholder | Description
------------|-------------
`{percentage}` | Battery level, in percent.
`{time}` | Time remaining until (dis)charge is complete.
`{power}` | Power consumption (in watts) by the battery or from the power supply when charging.

## Bluetooth

Creates a block which displays the connectivity of a given Bluetooth device, or the battery level if this is supported. Relies on the Bluez D-Bus API, and is therefore asynchronous.

When the device can be identified as an audio headset, a keyboard, joystick, or mouse, use the relevant icon. Otherwise, fall back on the generic Bluetooth symbol.

Right-clicking the block will attempt to connect (or disconnect) the device.

### Examples

A block for a Bluetooth device with the given MAC address:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "bluetooth"
mac = "A0:8A:F5:B8:01:FD"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`mac` | MAC address of the Bluetooth device. | Yes | None

## CPU Utilization

Creates a block which displays the overall CPU utilization, calculated from `/proc/stat`.

### Examples

format = "{barchart} {utilization}% {frequency}GHz"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`info` | Minimum usage, where state is set to info. | No | `30`
`warning` | Minimum usage, where state is set to warning. | No | `60`
`critical` | Minimum usage, where state is set to critical. | No | `90`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `1`
`format` | A format string. Possible placeholders: `{barchart}` (barchart of each CPU's core utilization), `{utilization}` (average CPU utilization in percent) and `{frequency}` (CPU frequency). | No | `"{utilization}%"`
`frequency` | Deprecated in favour of `format`. Sets format to `{utilization}% {frequency}GHz` | No | `false`


## Custom

Creates a block that display the output of custom shell commands.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
command = "uname"
interval = 100
```

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
cycle = ["echo ON", "echo OFF"]
on_click = "<command>"
interval = 1
```

### Options

Note that `command` and `cycle` are mutually exclusive.

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`command` | Shell command to execute & display. | No | None
`on_click` | Command to execute when the button is clicked. The command will be passed to whatever is specified in your `$SHELL` variable and - if not set - fallback to `sh`. | No | None

`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `20`
`show_percentage` | Show percentage of used/available disk space depending on info_type. | No | `false`

## Focused Window

Creates a block which displays the title of the currently focused window. Uses push updates from i3 IPC, so no need to worry about resource usage. The block only updates when the focused window changes title or the focus changes.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "focused_window"
max_width = 21
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`max_width` | Truncates titles to this length. | No | `21`

## IBus

Creates a block which displays the current global engine set in [IBus](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IBus). Updates are instant as D-Bus signalling is used.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "ibus"
```

## Keyboard Layout

Creates a block to display the current keyboard layout.

This block polls `setxkbmap` for the current layout by default, but can be configured to read asynchronous updates from the systemd `org.freedesktop.locale1` D-Bus path. Which of these two methods is appropriate will depend on your system setup.

### Examples

Check `setxkbmap` every 15 seconds:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "setxkbmap"
interval = 15
```

Listen to D-Bus for changes:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "localebus"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`driver` | One of `"setxkbmap"` or `"localebus"`, depending on your system. | No | `"setxkbmap"`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. Only used by the `"setxkbmap"` driver. | No | `60`

## Load

Creates a block which displays the system load average.

### Examples

Display the 1-minute and 5-minute load averages, updated once per second:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "load"
format = "{1m} {5m}"
interval = 1
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`format` | Format string. You can use the placeholders 1m 5m and 15m, e.g. `"1min avg: {1m}"`. | No | `"{1m}"`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `3`

## Maildir

Creates a block which shows unread mails. Only supports maildir format.

### Examples

inboxes = ["/home/user/mail/local", "/home/user/mail/gmail/Inbox"]
threshold_warning = 1
threshold_critical = 10
display_type = "new"
```

`icon` | Whether or not to prepend the output with the mail icon | No | `true`

## Memory

Creates a block displaying memory and swap usage.

By default, the format of this module is "<Icon>: {MFm}MB/{MTm}MB({Mp}%)" (Swap values accordingly). That behaviour can be changed within your config.

This module keeps track of both Swap and Memory. By default, a click switches between them.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "memory"
format_mem = "{Mum}MB/{MTm}MB({Mup}%)"
format_swap = "{SUm}MB/{STm}MB({SUp}%)"
display_type = "memory"
icons = true
clickable = true
interval = 5
warning_mem = 80
warning_swap = 80
critical_mem = 95
critical_swap = 95
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`format_mem` | Format string for Memory view. All format values are described below. | No | `"{MFm}MB/{MTm}MB({Mp}%)"`

## Music

Creates a block to display the current song title and artist in a fixed-width marquee. Also provides buttons for play/pause, previous and next.

Supports all music players that implement the [MediaPlayer2 Interface](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/Player_Interface.html). This includes:

- Spotify
- VLC
- mpd (via [mpDris2](https://github.com/eonpatapon/mpDris2))

and many others.

The block can be configured to drive a specific music player by name or automatically discover the currently active one.

### Examples

Show the currently playing song on Spotify only, with play & next buttons:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
player = "spotify"
buttons = ["play", "next"]
```

Same thing for any compatible player, takes the first active on the bus:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
buttons = ["play", "next"]
```

Start Spotify if the block is clicked whilst it's collapsed:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
on_collapsed_click = "spotify"
```


### Options

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "net"
device = "wlp2s0"
ssid = true
signal_strength = true
ip = true
speed_up = false
graph_up = true
interval = 5
```

### Options

## Nvidia Gpu

Proprietary nvidia driver required.

Creates a block which displays the Nvidia GPU utilization, temperature, used and total memory, fan speed, gpu clocks. You can set gpu label, that displayed by default.

Clicking the left button on the icon changes the output of the label to the output of the gpu name. Same with memory: used/total.

Clicking the left button on the fans turns on the mode of changing the speed of the fans using the wheel. Press again to turn off the mode. For this opportunity you need nvidia-settings!

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "nvidia_gpu"
label = "GT 1030"
show_memory = false
show_clocks = true
interval = 1
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`gpu_id` | GPU id in system | No | 0
`label` | Display custom gpu label | No | ""
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `1`
`show_utilization` | Display gpu utilization. In percents. | No | `true`

```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `600` (10min)

## Sound

Creates a block which displays the volume level (according to PulseAudio or ALSA). Right click to toggle mute, scroll to adjust volume.

Requires a PulseAudio installation or `alsa-utils` for ALSA.

PulseAudio support is a feature and can be turned on (`--features "pulseaudio"`) / off (`--no-default-features`) during build with `cargo`.
If PulseAudio support is enabled the `"auto"` driver will first try to connect to PulseAudio and then fallback to ALSA on error.


Note that if you are using PulseAudio commands (such as `pactl`) to control your volume, you should select the `"pulseaudio"` (or `"auto"`) driver to see volume changes that exceed 100%.

### Examples

Change the default scrolling step width to 3 percent:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "sound"
step_width = 3
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`driver` | `"auto"`, `"pulseaudio"`, `"alsa"` | No | `"auto"` (Pulseaudio with ALSA fallback)
`name` | PulseAudio / ALSA device name | No | Default Device (`@DEFAULT_SINK@` / `Master`)
`step_width` | The percent volume level is increased/decreased for the selected audio device when scrolling. Capped automatically at 50. | No | `5`
`on_click` | Shell command to run when the sound block is clicked. | No | None
`show_volume_when_muted` | Show the volume even if it is currently muted. | No | `false

## Speed Test

Creates a block which uses [`speedtest-cli`](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) to measure your ping, download, and upload speeds.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "speedtest"
bytes = true
interval = 1800
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`bytes` | Whether to use bytes or bits in the display (true for bytes, false for bits). | No | `false`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `1800`

## Temperature

Creates a block which displays the system temperature, based on lm_sensors' `sensors -u` output. The block has two modes: "collapsed", which uses only colour as an indicator, and "expanded", which shows the content of a `format` string.

Requires `lm_sensors` and appropriate kernel modules for your hardware.

The average, minimum, and maximum temperatures are computed using all sensors displayed by `sensors -u`, or the subset matching the chip name, if `chip` is specified.

Note that the colour of the block is always determined by the maximum temperature across all sensors, not the average. You may need to keep this in mind if you have a misbehaving sensor.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "temperature"
collapsed = false
interval = 10
format = "{min}° min, {max}° max, {average}° avg"
chip = "*-isa-*"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | 5
`collapsed` | Whether the block will be collapsed by default. | No | `true`
`good` | Maximum temperature to set state to good. | No | `20`
`idle` | Maximum temperature to set state to idle. | No | `45`
`info` | Maximum temperature to set state to info. | No | `60`
`warning` | Maximum temperature to set state to warning. Beyond this temperature, state is set to critical. | No | `80`
`chip` | Narrows the results to a given chip name. `*` may be used as a wildcard. | No | None

### Available Format Keys

Key | Value
----|-------
`{min}` | Minimum temperature among all sensors.
`{average}` | Average temperature among all sensors.
`{max}` | Maximum temperature among all sensors.

## Time

Creates a block which display the current time.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "time"
format = "%a %d/%m %R"
timezone = "US/Pacific"
interval = 60
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`format` | Format string. See the [chrono docs](https://docs.rs/chrono/0.3.0/chrono/format/strftime/index.html#specifiers) for all options. | No | `"%a %d/%m %R"`
`on_click` | Shell command to run when the time block is clicked. | No | None
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | 5
`timezone` | A timezone specifier (e.g. "Europe/Lisbon") | No | Local timezone

## Toggle

Creates a toggle block. You can add commands to be executed to disable the toggle (`command_off`), and to enable it (`command_on`).
You also need to specify a command to determine the (initial) state of the toggle (`command_state`). When the command outputs nothing, the toggle is disabled, otherwise enabled.
By specifying the `interval` property you can let the `command_state` be executed continuously.

### Examples

This is what I use to toggle my external monitor configuration:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "toggle"

text = "4k"
command_state = "xrandr | grep DP1\\ connected\\ 38 | grep -v eDP1"
command_on = "~/.screenlayout/4kmon_default.sh"
command_off = "~/.screenlayout/builtin.sh"
interval = 5
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`text` | Label to include next to the toggle icon. | No | ""
`command_on` | Shell Command to enable the toggle | Yes | None
`command_off` | Shell Command to disable the toggle | Yes | None
`command_state` | Shell Command to determine toggle state. Empty output => off. Any output => on.| Yes | None
`icon_on` | Icon override for the toggle button while on. | No | "toggle_on"
`icon_off` | Icon override for the toggle button while off. | No | "toggle_off"
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | None

## Weather

Creates a block which displays local weather and temperature information. In order to use this block, you will need access to a supported weather API service. At the time of writing, OpenWeatherMap is the only supported service.

Configuring the Weather block requires configuring a weather service, which may require API keys and other parameters.

### Examples

Show detailed weather in San Francisco through the OpenWeatherMap service:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "weather"
format = "{weather} ({location}) {temp}°, {wind} m/s {direction}"
service = { name = "openweathermap", api_key = "XXX", city_id = "5398563", units = "metric" }
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`format` | The text format of the weather display. | No | `"{weather} {temp}°"`
`service` | The configuration of a weather service (see below). | Yes | None
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `600`

### OpenWeatherMap Options

To use the service you will need a (free) API key.

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`name` | `openweathermap` | Yes | None
`api_key` | Your OpenWeatherMap API key. | Yes | None
`city_id` | OpenWeatherMap's ID for the city. | Yes | None
`units` | One of `metric` or `imperial`. | Yes | None

The options `api_key` and/or `city_id` can be omitted from configuration,
in which case they must be provided in the environment variables
`OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` and/or `OPENWEATHERMAP_CITY_ID`.

### Available Format Keys

Key | Value
----|-------
`{location}` | Location name (exact format depends on the service).
`{temp}` | Temperature.
`{weather}` | Textual description of the weather, e.g. "Raining".
`{wind}` | Wind speed.
