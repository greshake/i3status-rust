## Apt 

Creates a block which displays the pending updates available for your Debian/Ubuntu based system.

Behind the scenes this uses `apt`, and in order to run it without root priveleges i3status-rust will create its own package database in `/tmp/i3rs-apt/` which may take up several MB or more. If you have a custom apt config then this block may not work as expected - in that case please open an issue.

#### Examples

Update the list of pending updates every thirty minutes (1800 seconds):

```toml
[[block]]
block = "apt"
interval = 1800
format = "{count} updates available"
format_singular = "{count} update available"
format_up_to_date = "system up to date"
critical_updates_regex = "(linux |linux-lts|linux-zen)"
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`interval` | Update interval in seconds. | No | `600`
`format` | A string to customise the output of this block. See below for available placeholders. Text may need to be escaped, refer to [Escaping Text](#escaping-text). | No | `"{count}"`
`format_singular` | Same as `format`, but for when exactly one update is available. | No | `"{count}"`
`format_up_to_date` | Same as `format`, but for when no updates are available. | No | `"{count}"`
`warning_updates_regex` | Display block as warning if updates matching regex are available. | No | `None`
`critical_updates_regex` | Display block as critical if updates matching regex are available. | No | `None`

#### Available Format Keys

Key | Value
----|-------
`{count}` | Number of updates available

## Backlight

Creates a block to display screen brightness. This is a simplified version of the [Xrandr](#xrandr) block that reads brightness information directly from the filesystem, so it works under Wayland. The block uses `inotify` to listen for changes in the device's brightness directly, so there is no need to set an update interval.

When there is no `device` specified, this block will display information from the first device found in the `/sys/class/backlight` directory. If you only have one display, this approach should find it correctly.

It is possible to set the brightness using this block as well -- [see below](#setting-brightness-with-the-mouse-wheel) for details.

#### Examples

Show brightness for a specific device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
device = "intel_backlight"
```

Show brightness for the default device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`device` | The `/sys/class/backlight` device to read brightness information from. | No | Default device
`step_width` | The brightness increment to use when scrolling, in percent. | No | `5`
`root_scaling` | Scaling exponent reciprocal (ie. root). | No | `1.0`

Some devices expose raw values that are best handled with nonlinear scaling. The human perception of lightness is close to the cube root of relative luminance, so settings for `root_scaling` between 2.4 and 3.0 are worth trying. For devices with few discrete steps this should be 1.0 (linear). More information: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightness>

#### Setting Brightness with the Mouse Wheel

The block allows for setting brightness with the mouse wheel. However, depending on how you installed i3status-rust, it may not have the appropriate permissions to modify these files, and will fail silently. To remedy this you can write a `udev` rule for your system (if you are comfortable doing so).

First, check that your user is a member of the "video" group using the `groups` command. Then add a rule in the `/etc/udev/rules.d/` directory containing the following, for example in `backlight.rules`:

```
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", GROUP="video", MODE="0664"
```

This will allow the video group to modify all backlight devices. You will also need to restart for this rule to take effect.

###### [↥ back to top](#list-of-available-blocks)

## Battery

Creates a block which displays the current battery state (Full, Charging or Discharging), percentage charged and estimate time until (dis)charged.

The battery block collapses when the battery is fully charged -- or, in the case of some Thinkpad batteries, when it reports "Not charging".

The battery block supports reading charging and status information from either `sysfs` or the [UPower](https://upower.freedesktop.org/) D-Bus interface. These "drivers" have largely identical features, but UPower does include support for `device = "DisplayDevice"`, which treats all physical power sources as a single logical battery. This is particularly useful if your system has multiple batteries.

#### Examples

Update the battery state every ten seconds, and show the time remaining until (dis)charging is complete:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "battery"
interval = 10
format = "{percentage}% {time}"
```

Rely on Upower for battery updates and information:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "battery"
driver = "upower"
format = "{percentage}% {time}"
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`device` | The device in `/sys/class/power_supply/` to read from. When using UPower, this can also be `"DisplayDevice"`. | No | `"BAT0"`
`driver` | One of `"sysfs"` or `"upower"`. | No | `"sysfs"`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. Only relevant for `driver = "sysfs"`. | No | `10`
`format` | A string to customise the output of this block. See below for available placeholders. Text may need to be escaped, refer to [Escaping Text](#escaping-text). | No | `"{percentage}%"`
`full_format` | Same as `format` but for when the battery is full. | No | `"{percentage}%"`
`missing_format` | The format string that's used when a battery is missing. | No | `"{percentage}%"`
`allow_missing` | Don't display errors when the battery cannot be found. Only works with the `sysfs` driver. | No | `false`
`hide_missing` | Completely hide this block if the battery cannot be found. Only works in combination with `allow_missing`. | No | `false`
`info` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to info. | No | `60`
`good` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to good. | No | `60`
`warning` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to warning. | No | `30`
`critical` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to critical. | No | `15`

#### Deprecated Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`show` | Deprecated in favour of `format`. Show remaining `"time"`, `"percentage"` or `"both"`. | No | `"percentage"`
`upower` | Deprecated in favour of `device`. When `true`, use the Upower D-Bus driver. | No | `false`

The `show` option is deprecated, and will be removed in future versions. In the meantime, it will override the `format` option when present.

#### Available Format Keys

Placeholder | Description
------------|-------------
`{percentage}` | Battery level, in percent
`{bar}` | The current battery level in a bar chart
`{time}` | Time remaining until (dis)charge is complete
`{power}` | Power consumption (in watts) by the battery or from the power supply when charging

###### [↥ back to top](#list-of-available-blocks)

## Bluetooth

Creates a block which displays the connectivity of a given Bluetooth device, or the battery level if this is supported. Relies on the Bluez D-Bus API, and is therefore asynchronous.

When the device can be identified as an audio headset, a keyboard, joystick, or mouse, use the relevant icon. Otherwise, fall back on the generic Bluetooth symbol.

Right-clicking the block will attempt to connect (or disconnect) the device.

#### Examples

A block for a Bluetooth device with the given MAC address:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "bluetooth"
mac = "A0:8A:F5:B8:01:FD"
label = " Rowkin"
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------

#### Deprecated Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`frequency` | Deprecated in favour of `format`. Sets format to `{utilization}% {frequency}GHz`. | No | `false`

#### Available Format Keys

Placeholder | Description

`{frequency}` | CPU frequency in Hz

###### [↥ back to top](#list-of-available-blocks)

## Custom

Creates a block that display the output of custom shell commands.

For further customisation, use the `json` option and have the shell command output valid JSON in the schema below:  
`{"icon": "ICON", "state": "STATE", "text": "YOURTEXT"}`  
`icon` is optional, it may be an icon name from `icons.rs` (default "")  
`state` is optional, it may be Idle, Info, Good, Warning, Critical (default Idle)  

#### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
command = ''' cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp | awk '{printf("%.1f\n",$1/1000)}' '''
```

Cycle between "ON" and "OFF", update every 1 second, run `<command>` when block is clicked:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
cycle = ["echo ON", "echo OFF"]
on_click = "<command>"
interval = 1
```

Use JSON output:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
command = "echo '{\"icon\":\"weather_thunder\",\"state\":\"Critical\", \"text\": \"Danger!\"}'"
json = true
```

Display kernel, update the block only once:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
command = "uname -r"
interval = "once"
```

Display the screen brightness on an intel machine and update this only when `pkill -SIGRTMIN+4 i3status-rs` is called:

## Music

Creates a block to display the current song title and artist in a fixed-width marquee. Also provides buttons for play/pause, previous and next.
When there is no song playing the block collapses to show just the icon and any configured buttons.

Supports all music players that implement the [MediaPlayer2 Interface](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/Player_Interface.html). This includes:

- Spotify
- VLC
- mpd (via [mpDris2](https://github.com/eonpatapon/mpDris2))

and many others.

By default the block tracks all players available on the MPRIS bus. Right clicking on the block will cycle it to the next player (if the next player has no song playing then the block will collapse, however you can continue to right click to the next player.).  You can pin the widget to a given player via the "player" setting.

#### Examples

Show the currently playing song on Spotify only, with play & next buttons:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
player = "spotify"
buttons = ["play", "next"]
```

Same thing for any compatible player, takes the first active on the bus, but ignores "mpd" or anything with "kdeconnect" in the name:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
buttons = ["play", "next"]
interface_name_exclude = [".*kdeconnect.*", "mpd"]
```

Start Spotify if the block is clicked whilst it's collapsed:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
on_collapsed_click = "spotify"
```

# If ZFS is available, we know that we can and should do an upgrade, so we show 
# the status as critical.
critical_updates_regex = "(zfs |zfs-lts)"
```

pacman and AUR helper config:

```toml

## Sound

Creates a block which displays the volume level (according to PulseAudio or ALSA). Right click to toggle mute, scroll to adjust volume.

Requires a PulseAudio installation or `alsa-utils` for ALSA.

PulseAudio support is a feature and can be turned on (`--features "pulseaudio"`) / off (`--no-default-features`) during build with `cargo`.
If PulseAudio support is enabled the `"auto"` driver will first try to connect to PulseAudio and then fallback to ALSA on error.

Note that if you are using PulseAudio commands (such as `pactl`) to control your volume, you should select the `"pulseaudio"` (or `"auto"`) driver to see volume changes that exceed 100%.

#### Examples

Change the default scrolling step width to 3 percent:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "sound"
step_width = 3
```

```toml
[[block]]
block = "sound"
format = "{output_name} {volume}"
[block.mappings]
"alsa_output.usb-Harman_Multimedia_JBL_Pebbles_1.0.0-00.analog-stereo" = "🔈"

`step_width` | The percent volume level is increased/decreased for the selected audio device when scrolling. Capped automatically at 50. | No | `5`
`max_vol` | Max volume in percent that can be set via scrolling. Note it can still be set above this value if changed by another application. | No | `None`
`on_click` | Shell command to run when the sound block is clicked. | No | None

tasks. If there are no filters configured, the number of tasks stays the same and both modes are behaving
equally.  

#### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "taskwarrior"
interval = 60
format = "{count} open tasks"
format_singular = "{count} open task"
format_everything_done = "nothing to do!"

The average, minimum, and maximum temperatures are computed using all sensors displayed by `sensors -j`, or optionally filtered by `chip` and `inputs`.

Note that the colour of the block is always determined by the maximum temperature across all sensors, not the average. You may need to keep this in mind if you have a misbehaving sensor.

#### Examples

```toml

## Toggle

Creates a toggle block. You can add commands to be executed to disable the toggle (`command_off`), and to enable it (`command_on`). If these command exit with a non-zero status, the block will not be toggled and the block state will be changed to give a visual warning of the failure.
You also need to specify a command to determine the initial state of the toggle (`command_state`). When the command outputs nothing, the toggle is disabled, otherwise enabled.
By specifying the `interval` property you can let the `command_state` be executed continuously.

#### Examples

This is what I use to toggle my external monitor configuration:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "toggle"

text = "4k"
command_state = "xrandr | grep DP1\\ connected\\ 38 | grep -v eDP1"
command_on = "~/.screenlayout/4kmon_default.sh"
command_off = "~/.screenlayout/builtin.sh"
interval = 5
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`text` | Label to include next to the toggle icon. | No | `""`
`command_on` | Shell Command to enable the toggle. | Yes | None
`command_off` | Shell Command to disable the toggle. | Yes | None
`command_state` | Shell Command to determine toggle state. Empty output => off. Any output => on. | Yes | None
`icon_on` | Icon override for the toggle button while on. | No | `"toggle_on"`
`icon_off` | Icon override for the toggle button while off. | No | `"toggle_off"`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | None

## Uptime
Creates a block which displays system uptime. The block will always display the 2 biggest units, so minutes and seconds, or hours and minutes or days and hours or weeks and days.

#### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "uptime"
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`interval` | Update interval in seconds. | No | `60`

## Watson

[Watson](http://tailordev.github.io/Watson/) is a simple CLI time tracking application. This block will show the name of your current active project, tags and optionally recorded time. Clicking the widget will toggle the `show_time` variable dynamically.

#### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "watson"
show_time = true
state_path = "/home/user/.config/watson/state"
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`show_time` | Whether to show recorded time. | No | `false`
`state_path` | Path to the Watson state file. | No | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/watson/state`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `60`

## Weather

Creates a block which displays local weather and temperature information. In order to use this block, you will need access to a supported weather API service. At the time of writing, OpenWeatherMap is the only supported service.

Configuring the Weather block requires configuring a weather service, which may require API keys and other parameters.

If using the `autolocate` feature, set the block update interval such that you do not exceed ipapi.co's free daily limit of 1000 hits.

#### Examples

Show detailed weather in San Francisco through the OpenWeatherMap service:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "weather"
format = "{weather} ({location}) {temp}°, {wind} m/s {direction}"
service = { name = "openweathermap", api_key = "XXX", city_id = "5398563", units = "metric" }
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`format` | A string to customise the output of this block. See below for available placeholders. Text may need to be escaped, refer to [Escaping Text](#escaping-text). | No | `"{weather} {temp}°"`
`service` | The configuration of a weather service (see below). | Yes | None
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `600`
`autolocate` | Gets your location using the ipapi.co IP location service (no API key required). If the API call fails then the block will fallback to `city_id` or `place`. | No | false

#### OpenWeatherMap Options

To use the service you will need a (free) API key.

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`name` | `openweathermap`. | Yes | None
`api_key` | Your OpenWeatherMap API key. | Yes | None
`city_id` | OpenWeatherMap's ID for the city. | Yes* | None
`place` | OpenWeatherMap 'By city name' search query. See [here](https://openweathermap.org/current) | Yes* | None
`units` | Either `metric` or `imperial`. | Yes | `metric`

Either one of `city_id` or `place` is required. If both are supplied, `city_id` takes precedence.

The options `api_key`, `city_id`, `place` can be omitted from configuration,
in which case they must be provided in the environment variables
`OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY`, `OPENWEATHERMAP_CITY_ID`, `OPENWEATHERMAP_PLACE`.

#### Available Format Keys

Key | Value
----|-------
`{location}` | Location name (exact format depends on the service)
`{temp}` | Temperature
`{apparent}` | Australian Apparent Temperature
`{humidity}` | Humidity
`{weather}` | Textual description of the weather, e.g. "Raining"
`{wind}` | Wind speed
`{direction}` | Wind direction, e.g. "NE"

## Xrandr

Creates a block which shows screen information (name, brightness, resolution). With a click you can toggle through your active screens and with wheel up and down you can adjust the selected screens brightness. Regarding brightness control, xrandr changes the brightness of the display using gamma rather than changing the brightness in hardware, so if that is not desirable then consider using the `backlight` block instead.

NOTE: Some users report issues (e.g. [here](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/issues/274) and [here](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/issues/668) when using this block. The cause is currently unknown, however setting a higher update interval may help.

#### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "xrandr"
icons = true
resolution = true
interval = 2
```

#### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`icons` | Show icons for brightness and resolution. | No | `true`
`resolution` | Shows the screens resolution. | No | `false`
`step_width` | The steps brightness is in/decreased for the selected screen (When greater than 50 it gets limited to 50). | No | `5`
`interval` | Update interval in seconds. | No | `5`

## Escaping text
For blocks where the `format` string or `command` output can be configured by the user, you may need to escape any Pango characters otherwise the block may fail to render (i3) and/or throw errors to stderr (sway).

### List of characters that require escaping

Char | Escaped
-----|--------
  `<`  | `&lt;`
  `>`  | `&gt;`
  `&`  | `&amp;`
  `'`  | `&#39;`

e.g.
```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
# need to escape ampersand
#command = "echo '<b>1 &</b>'"
# escaped ampersand
command = "echo '<b>1 &amp;</b>'"
```
