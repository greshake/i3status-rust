## Time
Creates a block which display the current time.

**Example**
```toml
[[block]]
block = "time"

interval = 60
format = "%a %d/%m %R"
```

**Options**

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
format | Format string.<br/> See [chrono docs](https://docs.rs/chrono/0.3.0/chrono/format/strftime/index.html#specifiers) for all options. | No | %a %d/%m %R
interval | Update interval in seconds | No | 5
on_click | A command with or without arguments | No | None


## Memory

Creates a block displaying memory and swap usage.

By default, the format of this module is "<Icon>: {MFm}MB/{MTm}MB({Mp}%)" (Swap values
accordingly). That behaviour can be changed within your config.

This module keeps track of both Swap and Memory. By default, a click switches between them.


**Example**
```toml
[[block]]
block = "memory"

format_mem = "{Mum}MB/{MTm}MB({Mup}%)"
format_swap = "{SUm}MB/{STm}MB({SUp}%)"
display_type = "memory"
icons = true
clickable = true
interval = 5
warning_mem = 80
warning_swap = 80
critical_mem = 95
critical_swap = 95
```

**Options**

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
format_mem | Format string for Memory view. All format values are described below. | No | {MFm}MB/{MTm}MB({Mp}%)
format_swap | Format string for Swap view. | No | {SFm}MB/{STm}MB({Sp}%)
display_type | Default view displayed on startup. Options are <br/> memory, swap | No | memory
icons | Whether the format string should be prepended with Icons. Options are <br/> true, false | No | true
clickable | Whether the view should switch between memory and swap on click. Options are <br/> true, false | No | true
interval | The delay in seconds between an update. If `clickable`, an update is triggered on click. Integer values only. | No | 5
warning_mem | Percentage of memory usage, where state is set to warning | No | 80.0
warning_swap | Percentage of swap usage, where state is set to warning | No | 80.0
critical_mem | Percentage of memory usage, where state is set to critical | No | 95.0
critical_swap | Percentage of swap usage, where state is set to critical | No | 95.0

## Toggle
Creates a toggle block. You can add commands to be executed to disable the toggle (`command_off`), and to enable it (`command_on`).
You also need to specify a command to determine the (initial) state of the toggle (`command_state`). When the command outputs nothing, the toggle is disabled, otherwise enabled.
By specifying the `interval` property you can let the `command_state` be executed continuously.

**Example**
This is what I use to toggle my external monitor configuration:
```toml
[[block]]

command_state = "xrandr | grep DP1\\ connected\\ 38 | grep -v eDP1"
command_on = "~/.screenlayout/4kmon_default.sh"
command_off = "~/.screenlayout/builtin.sh"
interval = 5
```

alias | Alias that is displayed for path | No | /
info_type | Currently supported options are available and free | No | available
unit | Unit that is used to display disk space. Options are MB, MiB, GB and GiB | No | GB
interval | Update interval in seconds | No | 20

## Sound

Creates a block which displays the volume level (according to ALSA). Right click to toggle mute, scroll to adjust volume.

The display is updated when ALSA detects changes, so there is no need to set an update interval.

### Examples

Change the default scrolling step width to 3 percent:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "sound"
step_width = 3
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
step\_width | The percent volume level is increased/decreased for the selected audio device when scrolling. Capped automatically at 50. | No | 5
on_click | A command with or without arguments | No | None

## Temperature
Creates a block which displays the system temperature, based on lm_sensors' `sensors` output. The block is collapsed by default, and can be expanded by clicking, showing max and avg temperature. When collapsed, the color of the temperature block gives a quick indication as to the temperature (Critical when maxtemp > 80°, Warning when > 60°). Currently, you can only adjust these thresholds in source code. **Depends on lm_sensors being installed and configured!**

**Example**
```toml
[[block]]
block = "temperature"

interval = 10
collapsed = false
```

**Options**

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
interval | Update interval in seconds | No | 5
collapsed | Collapsed by default? | No | true

## Focused Window
Creates a block which displays the title of the currently focused window. Uses push updates from i3 IPC, so no need to worry about resource usage. The block only updates when the focused window changes title or the focus changes.

**Example**
```toml
[[block]]
block = "focused_window"

max_width = 21
```

**Options**

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
max_width | Truncates titles if longer than max_width | No | 21

## Xrandr
Creates a block which shows screen information (name, brightness, resolution). With a click you can toggle through your active screens and with wheel up and down you can adjust the selected screens brighntess.

Example
```toml
[[block]]
block = "xrandr"

interval = 2
icons = true
resolution = true
```

**Options**

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
interval | Update interval in seconds | No | 5
icons | Show icons for brightness and resolution (needs awesome fonts support) | No | true
resolution | Shows the screens resolution | No | false
step\_width | The steps brightness is in/decreased for the selected screen (When greater than 50 it gets limited to 50) | No | 5

## Backlight

Creates a block to display screen brightness. This is a simplified version of the [Xrandr](#xrandr) block that reads brightness information directly from the filesystem, so it works under Wayland. The block uses `inotify` to listen for changes in the device's brightness directly, so there is no need to set an update interval.

When there is no `device` specified, this block will display information from the first device found in the `/sys/class/backlight` directory. If you only have one display, this approach should find it correctly.

### Examples

Show brightness for a specific device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
device = "intel_backlight"
```

Show brightness for the default device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
device | The `/sys/class/backlight` device to read brightness information from. | No | Default device

## Net
Creates a block which displays the upload and download throughput for a network interface. Units are in bytes per second (kB/s, MB/s, etc).

**Example**
```toml
[[block]]
block = "net"
device = "wlp2s0"
interval = 5
ssid = true
ip = true
speed_up = false
graph_up = true
```

**Options**

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
device | Network interface to moniter (name from /sys/class/net) | Yes | lo (loopback interface)
interval | Update interval in seconds | No | 1
ssid | Display network SSID (wireless only) | No | false
bitrate | Display connection bitrate | No | false
ip | Display connection IP address | No | false
speed_up | Display upload speed | no | true
speed_down | Display download speed | no | true
graph_up | Display a bar graph for upload speed | no | false
graph_down | Display a bar graph for download speed | no | false

## Speed Test
Creates a block which uses [`speedtest-cli`](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) to measure your ping, download, and upload speeds.

**Example**
```toml
[[block]]
block = "speedtest"

bytes = true
interval = 1800
```

**Options**

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
bytes | whether to use bytes or bits in the display.<br>(true for bytes, false for bits) | No | false
interval | Update interval in seconds | No | 1800

## Weather

Creates a block which displays local weather and temperature information. In order to use this block, you will need access to a supported weather API service. At the time of writing, OpenWeatherMap is the only supported service.

Configuring the Weather block requires configuring a weather service, which may require API keys and other parameters.

### Examples

Show detailed weather in San Francisco through the OpenWeatherMap service:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "weather"
format = "{weather} ({location}) {temp}°, {wind} km/s"
service = { name = "openweathermap", api_key = "XXX", city_id = "5398563", units = "metric" }
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
interval | Update interval in seconds. | No | 600
format | The text format of the weather display. | No | {weather} {temp}°
service | The configuration of a weather service (see below). | Yes | None

### OpenWeatherMap Options

To use the service you will need a (free) API key.

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
name | `openweathermap` | Yes | None
api_key | Your OpenWeatherMap API key. | Yes | None
city_id | OpenWeatherMap's ID for the city. | Yes | None
units | One of `metric` or `imperial` | Yes | None

### Available Format Keys

Key | Value
----|-------
{location} | Location name (exact format depends on the service).
{temp} | Temperature.
