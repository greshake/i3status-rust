## Backlight

Creates a block to display screen brightness. This is a simplified version of the [Xrandr](#xrandr) block that reads brightness information directly from the filesystem, so it works under Wayland. The block uses `inotify` to listen for changes in the device's brightness directly, so there is no need to set an update interval.

When there is no `device` specified, this block will display information from the first device found in the `/sys/class/backlight` directory. If you only have one display, this approach should find it correctly.

It is possible to set the brightness using this block as well -- [see below](#setting-brightness-with-the-mouse-wheel) for details.

### Examples

Show brightness for a specific device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
device = "intel_backlight"
```

Show brightness for the default device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`device` | The `/sys/class/backlight` device to read brightness information from. | No | Default device
`step_width` | The brightness increment to use when scrolling, in percent. | No | `5`

### Setting Brightness with the Mouse Wheel

The block allows for setting brightness with the mouse wheel. However, depending on how you installed i3status-rust, it may not have the appropriate permissions to modify these files, and will fail silently. To remedy this you can write a `udev` rule for your system (if you are comfortable doing so).

First, check that your user is a member of the "video" group using the `groups` command. Then add a rule in the `/etc/udev/rules.d/` directory containing the following, for example in `backlight.rules`:

```
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", GROUP="video", MODE="0664"
```

This will allow the video group to modify all backlight devices. You will also need to restart for this rule to take effect.

## Battery

Creates a block which displays the current battery state (Full, Charging or Discharging), percentage charged and estimate time until (dis)charged.

The battery block collapses when the battery is fully charged -- or, in the case of some Thinkpad batteries, when it reports "Not charging".

The battery block supports reading charging and status information from either `sysfs` or the [UPower](https://upower.freedesktop.org/) D-Bus interface. These "drivers" have largely identical features, but UPower does include support for `device = "DisplayDevice"`, which treats all physical power sources as a single logical battery. This is particularly useful if your system has multiple batteries.

### Examples

Update the battery state every ten seconds, and show the time remaining until (dis)charging is complete:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "battery"
interval = 10
format = "{percentage}% {time}"
```

Rely on Upower for battery updates and information:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "battery"
driver = "upower"
format = "{percentage}% {time}"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`device` | The device in `/sys/class/power_supply/` to read from. When using UPower, this can also be `"DisplayDevice"`. | No | `"BAT0"`
`driver` | One of `"sysfs"` or `"upower"`. | No | `"sysfs"`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. Only relevant for `driver = "sysfs"`. | No | `10`
`format` | A format string. See below for available placeholders. | No | `"{percentage}%"`
`show` | Deprecated in favour of `format`. Show remaining `"time"`, `"percentage"` or `"both"` | No | `"percentage"`
`upower` | Deprecated in favour of `device`. When `true`, use the Upower D-Bus driver. | No | `false`
`info` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to info. | No | `60`
`good` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to good. | No | `60`
`warning` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to warning. | No | `30`
`critical` | Minimum battery level, where state is set to critical. | No | `15`

The `show` option is deprecated, and will be removed in future versions. In the meantime, it will override the `format` option when present.

### Format string

Placeholder | Description
------------|-------------
`{percentage}` | Battery level, in percent.
`{time}` | Time remaining until (dis)charge is complete.
`{power}` | Power consumption (in watts) by the battery or from the power supply when charging.

## Bluetooth

Creates a block which displays the connectivity of a given Bluetooth device, or the battery level if this is supported. Relies on the Bluez D-Bus API, and is therefore asynchronous.

When the device can be identified as an audio headset, a keyboard, joystick, or mouse, use the relevant icon. Otherwise, fall back on the generic Bluetooth symbol.

Right-clicking the block will attempt to connect (or disconnect) the device.

### Examples

A block for a Bluetooth device with the given MAC address:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "bluetooth"
mac = "A0:8A:F5:B8:01:FD"
label = " Rowkin"
```

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`mac` | MAC address of the Bluetooth device. | Yes | None
`label` | Text label to display next to the icon. | No | None


## CPU Utilization

Creates a block which displays the overall CPU utilization, calculated from `/proc/stat`.

format = "{barchart} {utilization}% {frequency}GHz"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`info` | Minimum usage, where state is set to info. | No | `30`
`warning` | Minimum usage, where state is set to warning. | No | `60`
`critical` | Minimum usage, where state is set to critical. | No | `90`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `1`
`format` | A format string. Possible placeholders: `{barchart}` (barchart of each CPU's core utilization), `{utilization}` (average CPU utilization in percent) and `{frequency}` (CPU frequency). | No | `"{utilization}%"`
`frequency` | Deprecated in favour of `format`. Sets format to `{utilization}% {frequency}GHz` | No | `false`
`per_core` | Display CPU frequencies and utilization per core. | No | `false`


## Custom

Creates a block that display the output of custom shell commands.

For further customisation, use the `json` option and have the shell command output valid JSON in the schema below:  
`{"icon": "ICON", "state": "STATE", "text": "YOURTEXT"}`  
`icon` is optional, it may be an icon name from `icons.rs` (default "")  
`state` is optional, it may be Idle, Info, Good, Warning, Critical (default Idle)  

### Examples

Display temperature, update every 10 seconds:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
command = ''' cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp | awk '{printf("%.1f\n",$1/1000)}' '''
```

Cycle between "ON" and "OFF", update every 1 second, run `<command>` when block is clicked:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
cycle = ["echo ON", "echo OFF"]
on_click = "<command>"
interval = 1
```

Use JSON output:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
command = "echo '{\"icon\":\"weather_thunder\",\"state\":\"Critical\", \"text\": \"Danger!\"}'"
json = true
```

Display kernel, update the block only once:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
command = "uname -r"
interval = "once"
```

### Options

Note that `command` and `cycle` are mutually exclusive.

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`command` | Shell command to execute & display. | No | None
`on_click` | Command to execute when the button is clicked. The command will be passed to whatever is specified in your `$SHELL` variable and - if not set - fallback to `sh`. | No | None
`cycle` | Commands to execute and change when the button is clicked. | No | None
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds (or `"once"` to update only once). | No | `10`

## Keyboard Layout

Creates a block to display the current keyboard layout.

Four drivers are available:
- `setxkbmap` which polls setxkbmap to get the current layout
- `localebus` which can read asynchronous updates from the systemd `org.freedesktop.locale1` D-Bus path
- `kbdd` which uses [kbdd](https://github.com/qnikst/kbdd) to monitor per-window layout changes via DBus
- `sway` which can read asynchronous updates from the sway IPC
 Which of these methods is appropriate will depend on your system setup.

### Examples

Check `setxkbmap` every 15 seconds:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "setxkbmap"
interval = 15
```

Listen to D-Bus for changes:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "localebus"
```

Listen to kbdd for changes:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "kbddbus"
```

Listen to sway for changes:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "keyboard_layout"
driver = "sway"
sway_kb_identifier = "1133:49706:Gaming_Keyboard_G110"
```

## Music

Creates a block to display the current song title and artist in a fixed-width marquee. Also provides buttons for play/pause, previous and next.

Supports all music players that implement the [MediaPlayer2 Interface](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/Player_Interface.html). This includes:

- Spotify
- VLC
- mpd (via [mpDris2](https://github.com/eonpatapon/mpDris2))

and many others.

The block can be configured to drive a specific music player by name or automatically discover the currently active one.

### Examples

Show the currently playing song on Spotify only, with play & next buttons:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
player = "spotify"
buttons = ["play", "next"]
```

Same thing for any compatible player, takes the first active on the bus:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
buttons = ["play", "next"]
```

Start Spotify if the block is clicked whilst it's collapsed:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "music"
on_collapsed_click = "spotify"
```


### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default

`player` | Name of the music player. Must be the same name the player is registered with the MediaPlayer2 Interface.  If unset, it will automatically discover the active player.  | Yes | None
`max_width` | Max width of the block in characters, not including the buttons | No | `21`
`marquee` | Bool to specify if a marquee style rotation should be used if the title + artist is longer than max-width | No | `true`
`marquee_interval` | Marquee interval in seconds. This is the delay between each rotation. | No | `10`
`marquee_speed` | Marquee speed in seconds. This is the scrolling time used per character. | No | `0.5`
`smart_trim` | When marquee rotation is disabled and the title + artist is longer than max-width, trim from both the artist and the title in proportion to their lengths, to try and show the most information possible. | No | `false`
`separator` | String to insert between artist and title | No | `" - "`
`buttons` | Array of control buttons to be displayed. Options are prev (previous title), play (play/pause) and next (next title) | No | `[]`
`on_collapsed_click` | Shell command to run when the music block is clicked while collapsed. | No | None

## Net

Creates a block which displays the upload and download throughput for a network interface. Units are by default in bytes per second (kB/s, MB/s, etc), 
but the 'use_bits' flag can be set to `true` to convert the units to bps (little b).

`bitrate` for wired devices requires `ethtool` to be installed.
`ssid` requires one of `iw`, `wpa_cli`, `nm-cli` or `iwctl` to be installed.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "net"
device = "wlp2s0"
ssid = true
signal_strength = true
ip = true
speed_up = false
graph_up = true
interval = 5

```toml
[[block]]
block = "pacman"
interval = 600
format = "{pacman} updates available"
format_singular = "{pacman} update available"
format_up_to_date = "system up to date"
critical_updates_regex = "(linux |linux-lts|linux-zen)"
```

pacman and AUR helper config:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "pacman"

## Pomodoro

Creates a block which runs a [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

You can face problems showing the nagbar if i3 is configured to hide the status bar. See
[#701](https://github.com/greshake/i3status-rust/pull/701) to fix this.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "pomodoro"
length = 25
break_length = 5
message = "Take a break!"
break_message = "Back to work!"
use_nag = true
nag_path = "i3-nagbar"
```

## Sound

Creates a block which displays the volume level (according to PulseAudio or ALSA). Right click to toggle mute, scroll to adjust volume.

Requires a PulseAudio installation or `alsa-utils` for ALSA.

PulseAudio support is a feature and can be turned on (`--features "pulseaudio"`) / off (`--no-default-features`) during build with `cargo`.
If PulseAudio support is enabled the `"auto"` driver will first try to connect to PulseAudio and then fallback to ALSA on error.


Note that if you are using PulseAudio commands (such as `pactl`) to control your volume, you should select the `"pulseaudio"` (or `"auto"`) driver to see volume changes that exceed 100%.

### Examples

Change the default scrolling step width to 3 percent:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "sound"
step_width = 3
```

```toml
[[block]]
block = "sound"
format = "{output_name} {volume}"
[block.mappings]
"alsa_output.usb-Harman_Multimedia_JBL_Pebbles_1.0.0-00.analog-stereo" = "🔈"
"alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo" = "🎧"

`device` | ALSA device name, usually in the form "hw:X" or "hw:X,Y" where `X` is the card number and `Y` is the device number as found in the output of `aplay -l` | No | `default`
`natural_mapping` | When using the ALSA driver, display the "mapped volume" as given by `alsamixer`/`amixer -M`, which represents the volume level more naturally with respect for the human ear | No | `false`
`step_width` | The percent volume level is increased/decreased for the selected audio device when scrolling. Capped automatically at 50. | No | `5`
`on_click` | Shell command to run when the sound block is clicked. | No | None
`show_volume_when_muted` | Show the volume even if it is currently muted. | No | `false`

## Speed Test

## Taskwarrior

Creates a block which displays number of pending and started tasks of the current users taskwarrior list.

Clicking the left mouse button on the icon updates the number of pending tasks immediately.

Clicking the right mouse button on the icon toggles the view of the block between filtered (default) and non-filtered
tasks. If there are no filters configured, the number of tasks stays the same and both modes are behaving
equally.  

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "taskwarrior"
interval = 60
format = "{count} open tasks"
format_singular = "{count} open task"
format_everything_done = "nothing to do!"
warning_threshold = 10
critical_threshold = 20
filter_tags = ["work", "important"]
```

----|-------
`{count}` | The number of pending tasks.

## Temperature

Creates a block which displays the system temperature, based on lm_sensors' `sensors -u` output. The block has two modes: "collapsed", which uses only colour as an indicator, and "expanded", which shows the content of a `format` string.

Requires `lm_sensors` and appropriate kernel modules for your hardware.

The average, minimum, and maximum temperatures are computed using all sensors displayed by `sensors -u`, or the subset matching the chip name, if `chip` is specified.

Note that the colour of the block is always determined by the maximum temperature across all sensors, not the average. You may need to keep this in mind if you have a misbehaving sensor.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "temperature"
collapsed = false
interval = 10
format = "{min}° min, {max}° max, {average}° avg"
chip = "*-isa-*"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `5`
`collapsed` | Whether the block will be collapsed by default. | No | `true`
`good` | Maximum temperature to set state to good. | No | `20`
`idle` | Maximum temperature to set state to idle. | No | `45`
`info` | Maximum temperature to set state to info. | No | `60`
`warning` | Maximum temperature to set state to warning. Beyond this temperature, state is set to critical. | No | `80`
`chip` | Narrows the results to a given chip name. `*` may be used as a wildcard. | No | None

```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`format` | Format string. See the [chrono docs](https://docs.rs/chrono/0.3.0/chrono/format/strftime/index.html#specifiers) for all options. | No | `"%a %d/%m %R"`

`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `5`
`timezone` | A timezone specifier (e.g. "Europe/Lisbon") | No | Local timezone

## Toggle

Creates a toggle block. You can add commands to be executed to disable the toggle (`command_off`), and to enable it (`command_on`). If these command exit with a non-zero status, the block will not be toggled and the block state will be changed to give a visual warning of the failure.
You also need to specify a command to determine the initial state of the toggle (`command_state`). When the command outputs nothing, the toggle is disabled, otherwise enabled.
By specifying the `interval` property you can let the `command_state` be executed continuously.

### Examples

This is what I use to toggle my external monitor configuration:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "toggle"

text = "4k"
command_state = "xrandr | grep DP1\\ connected\\ 38 | grep -v eDP1"
command_on = "~/.screenlayout/4kmon_default.sh"
command_off = "~/.screenlayout/builtin.sh"
interval = 5
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`text` | Label to include next to the toggle icon. | No | `""`
`command_on` | Shell Command to enable the toggle | Yes | None
`command_off` | Shell Command to disable the toggle | Yes | None
`command_state` | Shell Command to determine toggle state. Empty output => off. Any output => on.| Yes | None
`icon_on` | Icon override for the toggle button while on. | No | `"toggle_on"`
`icon_off` | Icon override for the toggle button while off. | No | `"toggle_off"`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | None


## Uptime
Creates a block which displays system uptime. The block will always display the 2 biggest units, so minutes and seconds, or hours and minutes or days and hours or weeks and days.

block = "uptime"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `60`


## Watson

`state_path` | Path to the Watson state file | No | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/watson/state`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `60`

## Weather

Creates a block which displays local weather and temperature information. In order to use this block, you will need access to a supported weather API service. At the time of writing, OpenWeatherMap is the only supported service.

Configuring the Weather block requires configuring a weather service, which may require API keys and other parameters.

If using the `autolocate` feature, set the block update interval such that you do not exceed ipapi.co's free daily limit of 1000 hits.

### Examples

Show detailed weather in San Francisco through the OpenWeatherMap service:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "weather"
format = "{weather} ({location}) {temp}°, {wind} m/s {direction}"
service = { name = "openweathermap", api_key = "XXX", city_id = "5398563", units = "metric" }
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`format` | The text format of the weather display. | No | `"{weather} {temp}°"`
`service` | The configuration of a weather service (see below). | Yes | None
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `600`
`autolocate` | Gets your location using the ipapi.co IP location service (no API key required). If the API call fails then the block will fallback to `city_id` or `place`. | No | false

### OpenWeatherMap Options

To use the service you will need a (free) API key.

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`name` | `openweathermap` | Yes | None
`api_key` | Your OpenWeatherMap API key. | Yes | None
`city_id` | OpenWeatherMap's ID for the city. | Yes* | None
`place` | OpenWeatherMap 'By city name' search query. See [here](https://openweathermap.org/current) | Yes* | None
`units` | One of `metric` or `imperial`. | Yes | None

Either one of `city_id` or `place` is required. If both are supplied, `city_id` takes precedence.

The options `api_key`, `city_id`, `place` can be omitted from configuration,
in which case they must be provided in the environment variables
`OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY`, `OPENWEATHERMAP_CITY_ID`, `OPENWEATHERMAP_PLACE`.

### Available Format Keys

Key | Value
----|-------
`{location}` | Location name (exact format depends on the service).
