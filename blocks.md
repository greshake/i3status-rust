## Backlight

Creates a block to display screen brightness. This is a simplified version of the [Xrandr](#xrandr) block that reads brightness information directly from the filesystem, so it works under Wayland. The block uses `inotify` to listen for changes in the device's brightness directly, so there is no need to set an update interval.

When there is no `device` specified, this block will display information from the first device found in the `/sys/class/backlight` directory. If you only have one display, this approach should find it correctly.

It is possible to set the brightness using this block as well -- [see below](#setting-brightness-with-the-mouse-wheel) for details.

### Examples

Show brightness for a specific device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
device = "intel_backlight"
```

Show brightness for the default device:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "backlight"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`device` | The `/sys/class/backlight` device to read brightness information from. | No | Default device
`step_width` | The brightness increment to use when scrolling, in percent. | No | `5`

### Setting Brightness with the Mouse Wheel

The block allows for setting brightness with the mouse wheel. However, depending on how you installed i3status-rust, it may not have the appropriate permissions to modify these files, and will fail silently. To remedy this you can write a `udev` rule for your system (if you are comfortable doing so).

First, check that your user is a member of the "video" group using the `groups` command. Then add a rule in the `/etc/udev/rules.d/` directory containing the following, for example in `backlight.rules`:

```
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", KERNEL=="acpi_video0", RUN+="/bin/chgrp video /sys/class/backlight/%k/brightness"
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", KERNEL=="acpi_video0", RUN+="/bin/chmod g+w /sys/class/backlight/%k/brightness"
```

You will need to ensure that the value of the `KERNEL` parameter here is the same as the `device` used to configure the block. (You will also need to restart for this rule to take effect.)

## Battery

Creates a block which displays the current battery state (Full, Charging or Discharging), percentage charged and estimate time until (dis)charged.

### Examples

Update the battery state every ten seconds:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "battery"
interval = 10
show = "both"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`device` | The device in `/sys/class/power_supply/` to read from. | No | `"BAT0"`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `10`
`show` | Show remaining 'time', 'percentage' or 'both' | No | `percentage`

## CPU Utilization

Creates a block which displays the overall CPU utilization, calculated from `/proc/stat`.

### Examples

Update CPU usage every second:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "cpu"
interval = 1
frequency = true
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`info` | Minimum usage, where state is set to info. | No | `30`
`warning` | Minimum usage, where state is set to warning. | No | `60`
`critical` | Minimum usage, where state is set to critical. | No | `90`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `1`
`frequency` | Shows avg cpu frequency in GHz | No | `false`

## Custom

Creates a block that display the output of custom shell commands.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
command = "uname"
interval = 100
```

```toml
[[block]]
block = "custom"
cycle = ["echo ON", "echo OFF"]
on_click = "<command>"
interval = 1
```

### Options

Note that `command` and `cycle` are mutually exclusive.

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`command` | Shell command to execute & display. | No | None
`on_click` | Command to execute when the button is clicked. The command will be passed to whatever is specified in your `$SHELL` variable and - if not set - fallback to `sh`. | No | None
`cycle` | Commands to execute and change when the button is clicked. | No | None

`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `20`

## Focused Window

Creates a block which displays the title of the currently focused window. Uses push updates from i3 IPC, so no need to worry about resource usage. The block only updates when the focused window changes title or the focus changes.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "focused_window"
max_width = 21
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`max_width` | Truncates titles to this length. | No | `21`

## Load

Creates a block which displays the system load average.

### Examples

## Memory

Creates a block displaying memory and swap usage.

By default, the format of this module is "<Icon>: {MFm}MB/{MTm}MB({Mp}%)" (Swap values accordingly). That behaviour can be changed within your config.

This module keeps track of both Swap and Memory. By default, a click switches between them.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]

## Nvidia Gpu

Proprietary nvidia driver required.

Creates a block which displays the Nvidia GPU utilization, temperature, used and total memory, fan speed, gpu clocks. You can set gpu label, that displayed by default.

Clicking the left button on the icon changes the output of the label to the output of the gpu name. Same with memory: used/total. 

Clicking the left button on the fans turns on the mode of changing the speed of the fans using the wheel. Press again to turn off the mode. For this opportunity you need nvidia-settings!

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "nvidia_gpu"
label = "GT 1030"
show_memory = false
show_clocks = true
interval = 1
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default

```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `600` (10min)

## Sound

Creates a block which displays the volume level (according to ALSA). Right click to toggle mute, scroll to adjust volume.

The display is updated when ALSA detects changes, so there is no need to set an update interval.

### Examples

Change the default scrolling step width to 3 percent:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "sound"
step_width = 3
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`step_width` | The percent volume level is increased/decreased for the selected audio device when scrolling. Capped automatically at 50. | No | `5`
`on_click` | Shell command to run when the sound block is clicked. | No | None

## Speed Test

Creates a block which uses [`speedtest-cli`](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) to measure your ping, download, and upload speeds.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "speedtest"
bytes = true
interval = 1800
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`bytes` | Whether to use bytes or bits in the display (true for bytes, false for bits). | No | `false`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `1800`

## Temperature

Creates a block which displays the system temperature, based on lm_sensors' `sensors` output. The block is collapsed by default, and can be expanded by clicking, showing max and avg temperature. When collapsed, the color of the temperature block gives a quick indication as to the temperature (Critical when maxtemp > 80°, Warning when > 60°). Currently, you can only adjust these thresholds in source code. **Depends on lm_sensors being installed and configured!**

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "temperature"
collapsed = false
interval = 10
format = "{min}° min, {max}° max, {average}° avg"
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
interval | Update interval, in seconds. | No | 5
collapsed | Collapsed by default? | No | true

## Time

Creates a block which display the current time.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "time"
format = "%a %d/%m %R"
interval = 60
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`format` | Format string. See the [chrono docs](https://docs.rs/chrono/0.3.0/chrono/format/strftime/index.html#specifiers) for all options. | No | `"%a %d/%m %R"`
`on_click` | Shell command to run when the sound block is clicked. | No | None
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | 5

## Toggle

Creates a toggle block. You can add commands to be executed to disable the toggle (`command_off`), and to enable it (`command_on`).
You also need to specify a command to determine the (initial) state of the toggle (`command_state`). When the command outputs nothing, the toggle is disabled, otherwise enabled.
By specifying the `interval` property you can let the `command_state` be executed continuously.

### Examples

This is what I use to toggle my external monitor configuration:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "toggle"

text = "4k"
command_state = "xrandr | grep DP1\\ connected\\ 38 | grep -v eDP1"
command_on = "~/.screenlayout/4kmon_default.sh"
command_off = "~/.screenlayout/builtin.sh"
interval = 5
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`command_on` | Shell Command to enable the toggle | Yes | None
`command_off` | Shell Command to disable the toggle | Yes | None
`command_state` | Shell Command to determine toggle state. Empty output => off. Any output => on.| Yes | None
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | None

## Weather

Creates a block which displays local weather and temperature information. In order to use this block, you will need access to a supported weather API service. At the time of writing, OpenWeatherMap is the only supported service.

Configuring the Weather block requires configuring a weather service, which may require API keys and other parameters.

### Examples

Show detailed weather in San Francisco through the OpenWeatherMap service:

```toml
[[block]]
block = "weather"
format = "{weather} ({location}) {temp}°, {wind} km/s"
service = { name = "openweathermap", api_key = "XXX", city_id = "5398563", units = "metric" }
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`format` | The text format of the weather display. | No | `"{weather} {temp}°"`
`service` | The configuration of a weather service (see below). | Yes | None
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `600`

### OpenWeatherMap Options

To use the service you will need a (free) API key.

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`name` | `openweathermap` | Yes | None
`api_key` | Your OpenWeatherMap API key. | Yes | None
`city_id` | OpenWeatherMap's ID for the city. | Yes | None
`units` | One of `metric` or `imperial`. | Yes | None

### Available Format Keys

Key | Value
----|-------
`{location}` | Location name (exact format depends on the service).
`{temp}` | Temperature.
`{weather}` | Textual description of the weather, e.g. "Raining".
`{wind}` | Wind speed.

## Uptime
Creates a block which displays system uptime. The block will always display the 2 biggest units, so minutes and seconds, or hours and minutes or days and hours or weeks and days.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "uptime"
```

### Options

None

## Xrandr

Creates a block which shows screen information (name, brightness, resolution). With a click you can toggle through your active screens and with wheel up and down you can adjust the selected screens brightness.

### Examples

```toml
[[block]]
block = "xrandr"
icons = true
resolution = true
interval = 2
```

### Options

Key | Values | Required | Default
----|--------|----------|--------
`icons` | Show icons for brightness and resolution (needs awesome fonts support) | No | `true`
`resolution` | Shows the screens resolution | No | `false`
`step_width` | The steps brightness is in/decreased for the selected screen (When greater than 50 it gets limited to 50) | No | `5`
`interval` | Update interval, in seconds. | No | `5`
